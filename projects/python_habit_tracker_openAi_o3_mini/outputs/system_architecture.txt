Below is a high-level architecture that meets the specification. The design is based on a layered (or “n-tier”) architecture to keep a clear separation between the presentation, business logic, and data layers. The diagram below is conceptual with each layer being responsible for well-defined concerns.

2. COMPONENT DESIGN DETAILS

A. Presentation Layer  
   • Role: Render the user interface (UI) and capture user interactions.
   • Options Based on Deployment:
  – Desktop:  
   • Use Tkinter (native Python GUI) or PyQt (richer UI) for a desktop application.
  – Web:  
   • Use Flask or Django to serve backend endpoints and provide a REST API;  
   • Couple with a responsive front-end framework like React, Angular, or even a simple HTML/CSS/JS setup.
   • Features:
  – Provide interfaces for habit CRUD operations and marking completions.
  – Allow interactive data visualization using integrated charts.
  – Include dialogs for confirmations (delete/edit actions) and accessible design features.

B. Business Logic Layer  
   • Role: Implement core domain logic and coordinate between the UI and data.
   • Modules/Components:
  1. Habit Manager Module:  
   – Handles creation, editing, and deletion of habits.  
   – Validates inputs (name, goal, schedule alignment, etc.).
  2. Completion Tracker Module:  
   – Manages habit completion records (daily and weekly tracking).
   – Implements business rules for streaks and aggregated progress.
  3. Reporting & Visualization Module:  
   – Generates data summaries (bar charts, line graphs) via Matplotlib.
   – Prepares CSV exports based on habit selection and date ranges.
   • Communication:  
  – Exposes services or APIs to the Presentation Layer.
   • Future Extensibility:  
  – Can integrate additional libraries (e.g., Plotly or Bokeh) without impacting the UI or data layers.

C. Data Access Layer  
   • Role: Abstract direct interactions with the SQLite database.
   • Implementation:
  – Use SQLAlchemy as an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tool.  
  – Define two main models:
   a. Habit (maps to the Habits table with fields like id, name, goal, schedule_type, etc.)
   b. Completion (maps to the Completions table, with a foreign key reference to Habit)
   • Data Integrity:  
  – Enforce foreign key relationships and constraints as specified (e.g., schedule validations).  
  – Utilize SQLAlchemy migrations (Alembic) for evolving the schema.
   • Benefits:
  – Abstracts database calls and supports the possibility of moving to another SQL engine, if required.

D. Configuration & Utility Layer  
   • Role: Centralize application settings and provide cross-cutting services.
   • Components:
  – Configuration Manager:  
   • Reads settings from a dedicated configuration file or module (e.g., database path, logging level).
  – Logging Service:  
   • Handles logging for debugging, error tracking, and audit purposes.
  – Backup/Migration Module:  
   • Uses Alembic for schema migrations and includes backup routines for the SQLite file.
   • Benefit:
  – Simplifies environmental configuration, making deployments (including containerized Docker deployments) more predictable.

3. TECHNOLOGY STACK SELECTION

A. Language & Runtime  
   • Python 3.8+ (ensuring compatibility with modern libraries and enhanced language features).

B. Presentation Layer Options  
   • Desktop Implementation:  
  – Tkinter or PyQt  
  – Packaging can be done via PyInstaller for cross-platform distribution.
   • Web Implementation:  
  – Backend Framework: Flask or Django (depends on team familiarity and requirements).  
  – Front-End:  
   • Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS, or a modern framework like React or Angular for greater interactivity.
  – API Communication: RESTful endpoints to bridge with the front end.

C. Business Logic & Data Access  
   • Python modules (separated into packages for habits, tracking, and reporting).
   • ORMs:  
  – SQLAlchemy as the primary ORM to interact with SQLite and abstract database operations.
   • Migrations:  
  – Alembic for managing schema changes over time.

D. Data Visualization & Reporting  
   • Matplotlib for static chart generation.
   • Consider optional integration with Plotly or Bokeh if interactive visualizations become a requirement in later stages.

E. Data Export  
   • Native Python CSV library (csv module) for generating file exports.
   • Alternatively, use Pandas for more complex export manipulation if needed.

F. Development & Deployment  
   • Dependency Management:  
  – Use requirements.txt, Pipenv, or Poetry to manage dependencies.
   • Environment Isolation:  
  – Virtual environments for development, and Docker containers for production consistency.
   • Testing Frameworks:  
  – pytest for unit and integration testing.
   • Continuous Integration (CI):  
  – Tools like GitHub Actions, Travis CI, or similar for automated testing and deployment builds.

4. COMPONENT INTERACTION FLOW (Example Scenario)

1. A user creates a new habit via the GUI (Presentation Layer).  
2. The input data is sent to the Habit Manager Module in the Business Logic Layer for validation and processing.  
3. Once validated, the Habit Manager uses the Data Access Layer (via SQLAlchemy) to persist the new habit record into the SQLite database.  
4. When a completion is marked, the Completion Tracker Module records the event; business rules compute streaks or summaries.  
5. The Reporting Module fetches data, generates charts with Matplotlib, and prepares CSV exports.  
6. Configuration and utility services ensure that application settings, logging, and backups function as needed.

5. DEPLOYMENT & MAINTENANCE CONSIDERATIONS

• Containerization and Virtual Environments:  
 – Use Dockerfiles to encapsulate the Python environment and dependencies.  
• Modular Codebase:  
 – Each layer/feature is developed as an independent module with clear interfaces, aiding maintainability and extensibility.  
• Automated Testing & Documentation:  
 – Unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end UI tests ensure future changes do not break functionality, along with comprehensive developer documentation.

6. CONCLUSION

This high-level system architecture offers a modular, layered approach that cleanly separates concerns and leverages robust Python libraries and frameworks. The design facilitates ease of development, future scalability (e.g., switching from SQLite if necessary), and clear paths for enhancements (like interactive visualizations or cross-platform support). By using familiar technologies—Python 3.8+, SQLAlchemy, and either desktop or web presentation frameworks—the solution aims to deliver both a proof-of-concept and a maintainable production-ready application.
