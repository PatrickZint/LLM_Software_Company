Below is a complete system specification document that details the feature set, quality attributes, and architectural recommendations for the habit tracking application based on the refined goals and environment profile.

──────────────────────────────
1. OVERVIEW

Purpose:
 Develop a habit tracking application to help users create, monitor, and sustain daily or weekly habits. The solution may be delivered as a desktop or web application with a refined graphical user interface (GUI) that provides interactive data visualizations and reporting capabilities.

Key High-Level Requirements:
 • Full habit management (creation, editing, deletion)
 • Habit completion tracking with historical data maintenance
 • A SQLite database for persistent data storage
 • Export capabilities in well-structured CSV format
 • Visual data summaries via charts (using Matplotlib or an alternative depending on interactivity needs)
 • Use Python 3.8+ and maintain a clear separation between presentation, business logic, and data layers

2. FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

A. Habit Management

 1. Create New Habit  
  • Input Fields:  
   – Habit Name/Title (mandatory)  
   – Description (optional)  
   – Goal (e.g., “Drink 8 glasses of water” or “Meditate for 10 minutes”)  
   – Schedule Type: Daily or Weekly  
   – Expected Frequency (daily count; weekly count for weekly habits)  
   – Start Date, with either an optional end date or an ongoing flag  
  • Validation Requirements:  
   – Ensure mandatory fields (Name, Goal, Schedule type, Expected Frequency, and Start Date) are provided.  
   – Validate that the “Expected Frequency” aligns with the chosen schedule.

 2. Edit and Delete Habit  
  • Edit:  
   – Allow modification of any habit details (e.g., update goal, change schedule type)  
  • Delete:  
   – Provide deletion functionality with a confirmation prompt to prevent accidental removals.

B. Habit Completion & Tracking

 1. Mark Habit as Completed  
  • Provide a user interface element (e.g., checkboxes, toggle buttons) to mark each habit as completed.  
  • Daily habits: Allow marking a habit on a fixed calendar day. Include functionality to retrospectively add a missed day if required.  
  • Weekly habits: Allow one of two approaches:
   – Mark a week as complete, or  
   – Support marking multiple completions within the weekly period if applicable.

 2. Progress Tracking  
  • Record each completion event in a persistent history.  
  • Business Logic:  
   – Define the criteria for a “completion” (e.g., if goal is multiple times per day, record individual events or use a daily summary approach).  
  • The completion history supports building statistics (streaks, best performance periods) and trend analysis.

C. Data Storage & Configuration

 1. SQLite Database  
  • Schema Design:  
   a. Habits Table  
    – Columns: id (primary key), name, description, goal, schedule_type (ENUM: ‘daily’, ‘weekly’), expected_frequency, start_date, end_date (nullable), ongoing_flag  
   b. Completions Table  
    – Columns: id (primary key), habit_id (foreign key), date (or week starting date), timestamp (exact time of mark-completion)  
  • Data Integrity:  
   – Define foreign key constraints to ensure that each completion maps to a valid habit record.  
   – Use CHECK constraints where applicable (e.g., schedule validations).

 2. Configuration Management  
  • Use a configuration file/module to specify:  
   – SQLite database file path  
   – Application-specific settings (e.g., debug mode, logging level)  
   – Database migration/back-up settings and any environment-specific parameters

D. Data Visualization

 1. Dashboard and Interactive Charts  
  • Provide a dashboard that aggregates habit progress in one main view.  
  • Utilize Matplotlib for charting, including:  
   – Bar charts, line graphs, or calendar views to illustrate progress over time  
  • Filtering:  
   – Enable filtering reports by date ranges, specific habits, or performance thresholds  
  • Additional Statistics:  
   – Display computed values (e.g., current streak, longest streak, best performance periods)

E. Data Export

 1. CSV Export  
  • Enable users to select one or more habits and specify a date range for export  
  • Produce well-structured CSV files with:  
   – Clear column headers for habit attributes and completion events  
   – One line per recorded completion or a structured summary row per chosen period  
  • Support local file system storage and provide feedback upon successful export

3. NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

A. Usability & User Interface
 • Intuitive, user-friendly GUI designed for users of various skill levels  
 • Include confirmation dialogs for sensitive operations (e.g., deletion, modification)  
 • Responsive design for web implementations to adapt across desktop and mobile devices  
 • Include accessibility guidelines (keyboard navigation, clear color contrasts, screen reader support)

B. Performance  
 • Efficient data retrieval and insertion operations to maintain quick responsiveness as the habit and history volume increases  
 • Optimize SQL queries and use indexes on frequently searched fields (e.g., habit_id in completions, dates)  
 • Use caching strategies, if needed, for visualizations that aggregate large datasets

C. Maintainability & Modularity  
 • Codebase organized using a modular architecture (e.g., Model-View-Controller [MVC] or similar separation of concerns)  
 • Implement configuration modules for database connectivity and application settings  
 • Provide detailed developer documentation covering module responsibilities, database schema evolution, and instructions for migrations/backups  
 • Dependency management using requirements.txt, Pipenv, or Poetry with Python ≥3.8

D. Security and Data Privacy  
 • Ensure that local SQLite files are stored in a secure location accessible only to the application user  
 • When applicable, integrate basic user authentication and safeguard any sensitive data  
 • Best practices for data handling (input validation, secure file access, and backups) to prevent data corruption or unauthorized access

4. SYSTEM DESIGN RECOMMENDATIONS

A. Architecture Overview
 • Layered Design:
  1. Presentation Layer:  
   – GUI implemented with a desktop framework (e.g., Tkinter, PyQt, or Electron if mixing with web technologies) or a web framework (Flask/Django with a React/Angular frontend)  
  2. Application/Business Logic Layer:  
   – Handles habit creation, modification, deletion, completion tracking, and business rules (e.g., streak computations).  
  3. Data Access Layer:  
   – Direct interface with the SQLite database. Consider abstraction via an ORM like SQLAlchemy to facilitate future migration to a more scalable database engine if needed.
  4. Reporting/Visualization Layer:  
   – Separate module for generating and exporting charts or CSV files.  
  5. Configuration & Utility Layer:  
   – Manages application settings, logging, backup, and migration routines.

B. Technology Stack Considerations
 • Python Version:  
  – A minimum of Python 3.8 ensures compatibility with current libraries.  
 • GUI/Front-end Technology:  
  – Desktop: Consider Tkinter or PyQt for native desktop applications.  
  – Web: Consider Flask or Django for the backend, with responsive front-end frameworks (or libraries) for improved UX.
 • Data Storage:  
  – SQLite3 is used initially, with the abstraction layer (via SQLAlchemy) to simplify potential future migrations.  
 • Visualization:  
  – Start with Matplotlib for static chart generation; be prepared to integrate interactive libraries (e.g., Plotly or Bokeh) if user requirements change.

C. Data Persistence & Integrity
 • Schema Design:  
  – Ensure tables are normalized with clear relationships and indexing strategies on frequently queried fields  
 • Migration:  
  – Document a migration process using tools (e.g., Alembic with SQLAlchemy) to support schema changes and updates.

D. Testing and Quality Assurance
 • Develop unit tests for individual modules (e.g., habit CRUD operations, data retrieval, CSV export)  
 • Integration tests to verify the complete workflow from data input to visualization and export  
 • Automated UI/functional tests using appropriate frameworks to simulate user interactions

E. Deployment and Environment Isolation
 • Use virtual environments for development and production to isolate dependencies  
 • Document a clear deployment strategy. For instance, use Docker containers to package the application, ensuring consistency across environments  
 • Outline backup mechanisms for the SQLite database and periodic schema updates

5. CONCLUSION

This specification details the functional and non-functional requirements for the habit tracking application. The recommended modular design and layered architecture ensure that the system is maintainable, scalable for future enhancements, and secure given the application's use of a local SQLite database for data storage. By using Python 3.8+, SQLite3, and Matplotlib (with potential future enhancements via interactive visualization libraries), the development team is equipped to deliver a proof‐of‐concept or lightweight solution that may eventually evolve into a more robust application with extended user or multi-platform support.

This document should serve as a baseline for further detailed design sessions, stakeholder review, and eventual implementation planning.
