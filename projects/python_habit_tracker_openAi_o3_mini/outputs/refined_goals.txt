Below is an analysis and a refined list of requirements that clarify the goals, expose assumptions, and ensure that the scope and functionality of the habit tracking application are clearly defined.

──────────────────────────────
1. High-Level Objectives

• Purpose: Build a habit tracking application that helps users establish, monitor, and maintain daily or weekly habits.  
• End Result: A fully functional desktop or web-based application with a graphical user interface (GUI).  
• Persistence: All habit and progress data is stored in a SQLite database.  
• Export/Reporting: Users can export their progress data as CSV files, and view progress via interactive charts.

2. Functional Requirements

A. Habit Management  
   1. Create New Habit  
      • Users can add new habits by specifying at least the following details:
         ◦ Name/title of the habit
         ◦ Description (optional)  
         ◦ Goal (e.g., “drink 8 glasses of water”, “meditate for 10 minutes”)  
         ◦ Schedule type: Daily or Weekly  
         ◦ Expected frequency (e.g., every day, 3 times a week)  
         ◦ Start date, and optionally, an end date or ongoing flag  
      • Validation: Ensure that key fields are provided and schedules are valid.

   2. Edit and Delete Habit  
      • Users can edit habit details if their preferences or goals change.  
      • Users can delete a habit, with a confirmation prompt to avoid accidental deletion.  
   
B. Habit Completion & Tracking  
   1. Mark as Completed  
      • Provide an interface (e.g., checkbox, button) to mark a habit as completed for a given day (or week).  
      • For weekly habits, support marking multiple completions (if applicable) or simply a weekly flag.
      • If a user misses a day for a daily habit, allow manual addition of a missed day (if the use case requires retrospective corrections).

   2. Progress Tracking  
      • Maintain a history of completions to visualize progress.  
      • Define business rules for “completion.” For example, if a habit’s goal is to be done multiple times per day, define whether each occurrence is recorded or if a daily summary is used.

C. Data Storage & Configuration  
   1. SQLite Database  
      • Define a relational schema that includes tables for:
         ◦ Habits (id, name, description, schedule type, goal, start date, etc.)
         ◦ Completions (id, habit_id, date, timestamp)
      • Ensure data integrity using appropriate foreign keys and constraints.
      • Provide configuration files (or a configuration module) to manage database connections, schema updates/migrations, and backups.

D. Data Visualization  
   1. Dashboard & Charts  
      • Present visual charts (e.g., bar charts, line graphs, calendars) to illustrate valid trends and progress over time.
      • Allow filtering data by date range, habit, and performance thresholds.
      • Optionally, enable users to see statistics, e.g., streak counts, best performance period, etc.

E. Data Export  
   1. CSV Export  
      • Provide functionality to export one or more habits’ data into CSV format.
      • Allow users to specify date ranges and/or individual habits to export.
      • CSV files should be structured with clear headers and multiple rows for habit completion entries.

──────────────────────────────
3. Non-Functional Requirements

A. Usability & Design  
   • The UI should be intuitive and accessible, with support for common screen sizes.  
   • Provide responsive design if a web-based solution is chosen, ensuring optimal performance on both desktop and mobile devices.  
   • Include user feedback and confirmation dialogs for key actions (e.g., adding or deleting habits).

B. Performance  
   • Ensure the application performs efficiently even as the number of tracked habits and records increases.
   • Optimize database access patterns to avoid slow UI responses.

C. Maintainability & Configuration  
   • Include configuration files (or settings module) for:
         ◦ Database connection string/parameters (host, port if applicable, file path for SQLite, etc.)
         ◦ Application settings (debug mode, logging level, UI preferences)
   • Document how to perform database migrations and backups.  
   • Use a modular architecture to simplify future enhancements, such as adding new visualization types or export formats.

D. Security and Data Privacy  
   • Although storing locally using SQLite, ensure that data is only accessible to the authorized user or client.
   • Provide standard practices for secure data handling and backup.

──────────────────────────────
4. Assumptions & Dependencies

• The application may be designed as either a desktop or web application. Dependencies (such as Electron for a desktop app or frameworks like React/Angular for a web app) should be clarified further.  
• The user is expected to run the application in a relatively trusted environment; however, basic user authentication and data privacy measures should be considered if sensitive information is involved.  
• Local file system access is acceptable for storing CSV exports and SQLite database files. In a multi-user or cloud scenario, additional modifications would be required.

──────────────────────────────
5. Open Questions to Clarify

• Platform: Should the application be web-based, mobile, or desktop?  
• Scheduling Complexity: Do we need recurring schedules beyond daily/weekly (e.g., weekdays only, specific days of the week)?  
• Notifications: Is there any requirement to send reminders or notifications for pending habits?  
• User Management: Will there be multiple user support (i.e., each user having access to their own habit set), or is it a single-user application?  
• Offline/Online: Is the SQLite database stored locally only, or will there be any synchronization with cloud storage?

──────────────────────────────
6. Summary of the Refined Goals

• Develop a habit tracking application with a clear, intuitive UI that allows users to create, update, and track daily/weekly habits.  
• Ensure that each habit can be marked as complete with a history maintained in a SQLite database.  
• Present progress visually via interactive charts and enable data export in CSV format.  
• Include sufficient configuration and modularity in the application design to support future expansions and maintainability.

This refined specification should serve as a solid foundation for further discussions with stakeholders, detailed design sessions, and eventual implementation planning.
