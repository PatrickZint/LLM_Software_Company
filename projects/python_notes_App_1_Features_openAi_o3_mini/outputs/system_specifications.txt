Below is a complete system specifications document that covers the functional requirements, non‐functional requirements, and system design recommendations for the note-taking application. This document is derived from the refined goals and environment profile provided.

────────────────────────────────────────
1. Introduction
────────────────────────────────────────
Objective:  
• Develop a lightweight, desktop-based note-taking application using Python 3.8+ and Tkinter.  
• The application will allow users to create, view, edit, and delete notes that are stored locally in a SQLite database.

Scope:  
• Core note management functionality (create, view, edit, delete)  
• Clear, simple, and accessible user interface  
• A configuration process to support local development, testing, and eventual cross-platform deployment  

Assumptions:  
• The initial version targets basic plain-text notes (rich-text or multimedia support will be considered later)  
• It will run on Windows, macOS, and Linux with regular cross-platform tests  
• Python’s built-in Tkinter is chosen for its simplicity, with plans to reassess if UI requirements grow in sophistication  

────────────────────────────────────────
2. Functional Requirements
────────────────────────────────────────
2.1 Note Entity and Data Model  
 a. Each note shall be represented as a record in the SQLite database with the following attributes:  
  • Note ID: Unique identifier (integer primary key, auto-incremented)  
  • Title: String (maximum 100 characters; mandatory)  
  • Content: Text (mandatory)  
  • Creation Timestamp: Date/Time value assigned when the note is created  
  • Last Modified Timestamp: Date/Time value updated on any edit  
  • (Optional) Tags/Categories: A string or comma‐separated value for future enhancements  
 b. Schema Requirements:  
  • A table named “notes” with appropriate columns and data types  
  • Support for future migrations via update scripts or schema versioning

2.2 User Interactions  
 a. Create Note:  
  • Provide a form with input fields for “Title” and “Content.”  
  • Validate that the title is not empty and within character limits (≤100 characters) and that the content is provided.  
  • On successful creation, record the creation timestamp and persist the note in the SQLite database.  
 b. View Notes:  
  • Display a main screen listing all notes. Each note in the list shall show key metadata (title, creation date).  
  • Allow a user to click/select a note to display full details in a “detail view.”  
 c. Edit Note:  
  • In the detail view, provide an option to edit the note.  
  • On submitting changes, update the note content and set the “Last Modified Timestamp” to the current time.  
  • Enforce the same validations as in note creation.  
 d. Delete Note:  
  • Provide a “Delete” action/button in the note’s detail view.  
  • Ensure that the system asks for confirmation (e.g., a dialog prompt) before performing deletion.  
  • Remove the note from the database upon confirmation and update the display.

2.3 Data Management  
 a. Local Storage:  
  • Use SQLite as the local database for persistence.  
  • On application start (or first run), check for the existence of the database file and initialize it if missing.  
  • Provide migration scripts or version checks to manage schema changes.  
 b. Auto-save (Optional Future Enhancement):  
  • Consider implementing an auto-save mechanism for active note editing (to be reviewed for version 2.0).

2.4 UI and Navigation Requirements  
 a. Main Screen / List View:  
  • A list or table UI element that displays existing notes (title, creation date).  
 b. Detail View:  
  • A screen displaying the selected note’s complete details, along with “Edit” and “Delete” options.  
 c. Input Forms:  
  • Clear and consistent forms for both note creation and editing.  
 d. Navigation:  
  • Allow easy movement between the list view and detail view (e.g., “Back” buttons or menus).  
 e. Feedback:  
  • Provide immediate visual confirmation on actions (e.g., “Note saved” or error messages for invalid inputs).

────────────────────────────────────────
3. Non-Functional Requirements
────────────────────────────────────────
3.1 Performance  
 • The application must open and load a list of notes in a few seconds on typical consumer hardware.  
 • Data retrievals from the SQLite database should be optimized for responsiveness, ensuring minimal delay during CRUD operations.

3.2 Security  
 • Validate and sanitize all user inputs to prevent code injection or malformed data entries.  
 • If future application versions store sensitive data, consider encrypting the SQLite database.  
 • Maintain secure handling of file paths, ensuring that the database is accessed only by authorized users (i.e., the local application instance).

3.3 Usability and Accessibility  
 • The graphical interface (Tkinter-based) must be simple, with clear labeling and intuitive icons/buttons for actions such as “Add,” “Edit,” and “Delete.”  
 • Adhere to accessibility standards:  
  – Support keyboard navigation  
  – Ensure readable font sizes and appropriate color contrast  
  – Clearly indicate focus for interactive elements  
 • Provide user-friendly error messages and guidance throughout the app.

3.4 Maintainability and Extensibility  
 • Structure the code in a modular fashion separating UI, business logic, and data access layers.  
 • Write and maintain unit tests for core functionalities (CRUD operations, validations, and database interactions).  
 • Document the codebase and architectural decisions, enabling easy onboarding and future enhancements (e.g., migration to a richer GUI framework for advanced UI needs).

3.5 Deployment and Configuration  
 • Manage dependencies through a configuration file (requirements.txt) for Python packages.  
 • Use virtual environments (e.g., venv) to isolate and manage dependencies.  
 • Provide scripts to set up and initialize the SQLite database – this includes creating the database file and applying the initial schema.  
 • Create build scripts or instructions for packaging the application for distribution (e.g., via PyInstaller or cx_Freeze) ensuring cross-platform compatibility.

────────────────────────────────────────
4. System Design Recommendations
────────────────────────────────────────
4.1 Architectural Overview  
 a. Layered Architecture:  
  • Presentation Layer (UI):  
   – Developed in Python using Tkinter.  
   – Contains windows/forms for note list, note detail, and note editing/creation.  
  • Business Logic Layer:  
   – Implements application-specific rules (validations, timestamp management).  
   – Coordinates between the UI and data access layers.  
  • Data Access Layer:  
   – Interfaces with the SQLite database using an ORM (e.g., SQLAlchemy) or lightweight custom database helper functions.  
   – Manages schema initialization and database migration routines.
 b. Modular Code Organization:  
  – Separate files or packages for models (Note), views (Tkinter UI components), controllers (business logic), and persistence (database access).

4.2 Technology Stack Recommendations  
 • Programming Language: Python 3.8 or later  
 • GUI Framework: Tkinter (with consideration for future migration to richer toolkits like PyQt or wxPython if needed)  
 • Database: SQLite – file-based for simplicity with planned init/migration scripts  
 • Package Management:  
  – requirements.txt for dependency tracking  
  – Use pip for package installations  
 • Virtual Environment: Use “venv” or conda for environment isolation.

4.3 Development and Deployment Considerations  
 • Development Environment:  
  – Use an IDE or text editor that supports Python (e.g., VS Code, PyCharm) with integrated testing and linting.  
  – Introduce version control (using Git) and a clear branching strategy.  
 • Deployment Strategy:  
  – Create build scripts (batch/shell scripts) to initialize the database and launch the application in both development and production modes.  
  – For distribution, use tools like PyInstaller to generate standalone executables for various OSes, ensuring that Tkinter is properly bundled.
 • Testing:  
  – Write automated unit tests for the creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion of notes.  
  – Schedule cross-platform (Windows, macOS, Linux) tests to validate UI behavior and database interactions.

4.4 Documentation and Future Enhancements  
 • Code Documentation and Inline Comments: Maintain clear inline documentation and generate API docs if needed.  
 • User Documentation: Prepare a “Getting Started” guide outlining installation procedures, basic usage, and troubleshooting tips.  
 • Future Roadmap Considerations:  
  – Synchronization with cloud storage and multi-device support.  
  – Enhanced UI capabilities including advanced formatting (rich text) or media attachments.  
  – Scalability improvements if moving from SQLite to a more robust database solution.
