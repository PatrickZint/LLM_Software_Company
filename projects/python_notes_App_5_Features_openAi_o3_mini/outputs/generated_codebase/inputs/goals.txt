Create a simple note-taking app allowing users to create, view, and delete personal notes.
Features:
Basic UI with a list of notes:
- Add new notes using a simple form
- Edit and delete existing notes
- Store notes locally in a SQLite database
Data Storage:
- Store notes locally in a SQLite database
- Each note has a title, content, and timestamp
Add support for note categories and tags:
- Implement a search function for notes
- Store note metadata (timestamps, tags, categories)
- Export and import notes as JSON files
Rich Text & Formatting:
- Support for Markdown and Rich-Text (bold, italic, headings, lists)
- Add highlighting and color options for notes
- Support code snippets with syntax highlighting
Authentication & Security (local):
- Implement local user accounts with username and password
- Securely store passwords using hashing (e.g., bcrypt or argon2)
- Encrypt all notes using a key derived from the user's password (AES or Fernet)
- Allow multiple users on the same device, each with their own notes
The result should be a functional application with a UI, so if necessary, create required config files.
