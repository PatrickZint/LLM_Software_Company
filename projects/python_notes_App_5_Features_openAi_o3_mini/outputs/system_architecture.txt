Below is a high-level system architecture that maps the specification’s functional and non‑functional requirements into a modular design. This design separates the concerns of user interaction, business logic, persistence, security, and data import/export, and also maps out a technology stack that meets the deliverables.

──────────────────────────────
1. OVERALL ARCHITECTURE LAYERS

A. Presentation Layer (User Interface)
 • Role:  
  – Provides the graphical interface using Tkinter and ttk for styling.  
  – Contains windows, dialogs, toolbars, menus, and custom text editor widgets.
 • Components:  
  – Main Window: Displays note listing, categories/tags sidebar, and status messages.  
  – Login/Registration Dialogs: For secure user authentication.  
  – Note Editor: A composite widget (Tkinter Text widget enhanced with tagging/formatting) for rich text editing.  
  – Import/Export Dialogs: Interfaces for file selection and JSON validation.
 • Technology Stack:  
  – Python 3.8+ with Tkinter/ttk  
  – Custom composite widgets when needed (e.g., Notebook widget for switching modes)

B. Business Logic Layer (Controller)
 • Role:  
  – Acts as the mediator between the UI and persistence/security layers.  
  – Implements CRUD operations, note processing, formatting toggles, and user session management.
 • Components:  
  – Note Manager: Handles creation, update, deletion, retrieval of note objects while coordinating encryption/decryption.  
  – User Manager: Handles registration, login, password validation, and session control.  
  – Search Controller: Manages filtering/search operations through SQLite FTS or indexed queries.  
  – Configuration Manager: Loads settings from config.json/YAML (e.g., database path, encryption parameters, UI preferences).  
 • Technology Stack:  
  – Python classes and modules with clear APIs enabling unit testing  
  – MVC or MVP pattern to enable separation of concerns

C. Data Access Layer (Persistence)
 • Role:  
  – Handles all communication with the SQLite database ensuring data consistency and transaction safety.  
  – Maps business objects (notes, user accounts) to persistent schema.
 • Components:
  – Database Manager:  
   ○ Manages connection to the SQLite database.  
   ○ Implements CRUD operations and uses transactions where needed.
  – Schema Repository:  
   ○ Implements database migration and indexing (i.e., indexes on User IDs, Note IDs, and full-text indexes for search).
  – Data Mapper/ORM-like layer:  
   ○ Although using raw SQL is acceptable for SQLite, an optional lightweight mapper can simplify CRUD operations.
 • Technology Stack:  
  – SQLite  
  – Python’s sqlite3 module (possibly SQLAlchemy in “core” mode if abstraction is desired, though not explicitly required)

D. Security and Encryption Module
 • Role:  
  – Provides protection for user logins and note contents using robust encryption and hashing schemes.
 • Components:
  – Encryption Engine:  
   ○ Encrypts note content (using AES or Fernet) before storage and decrypts on-the-fly during retrieval.  
   ○ Uses parameters from the config (e.g., key derivation using PBKDF2).
  – Password Hasher:  
   ○ Implements secure hashing (using bcrypt or Argon2) to protect user credentials.
  – Key Manager:  
   ○ Handles deriving and caching temporary keys based on user password upon login.  
   ○ Reads and validates encryption configuration from the settings file.
 • Technology Stack:  
  – cryptography library for encryption routines  
  – bcrypt or argon2 libraries for secure password hashing

E. Import/Export Module
 • Role:  
  – Enables JSON file import and export operations for notes, ensuring proper data validation and duplicate handling.
 • Components:
  – JSON Parser/Validator:  
   ○ Parses user-provided JSON data and validates against expected note data structure.  
   ○ Provides error feedback to the UI if mismatches are detected.
  – Exporter:  
   ○ Transforms internal note objects into JSON, preserving metadata such as categories, tags, and timestamps.
 • Technology Stack:  
  – Python’s built-in json module  
  – Custom error handling routines and validation logic

2. DATA FLOW OVERVIEW

A. Application Startup (Initialization)
 1. Load configuration (from config.json/YAML) using the Configuration Manager.
 2. Initialize logging based on configuration settings.
 3. Set up database connection via the Database Manager.
 4. Present the Login/Registration dialog via the Presentation Layer.

B. User Login and Session Start
 1. The User Manager authenticates using the secure Password Hasher.
 2. On successful login, the Encryption Engine derives a temporary decryption key from the user’s password.
 3. The UI is updated to show the user’s dashboard and note list.

C. CRUD Operations on Notes
 1. Create/Update:  
  – The Note Editor captures note input (title, content, metadata).  
  – Before storing, note content is sent to the Encryption Engine for encryption.  
  – The Business Logic Layer forwards the encrypted note to the Database Manager.
 2. Read:  
  – Notes are retrieved from SQLite, decrypted on‑the‑fly, and rendered in the Note Editor.
 3. Delete:  
  – A confirmation prompt is triggered by the UI, and on confirmation, the Business Logic instructs the Database Manager to remove the record.
 4. Search:  
  – The Search Controller issues queries (leveraging SQLite FTS or indexed searches) to filter notes.
  – Results are displayed in the UI list.

D. Import/Export Operations
 1. Export:  
  – The Exporter module gathers a set of notes, serializes them into a well‑structured JSON object, and offers a file save dialogue.
 2. Import:  
  – The JSON Parser reads the file and validates its structure before merging or updating local data via the Business Logic Layer.

3. TECHNOLOGY STACK SELECTION & PACKAGING

• Primary Programming Language:  
 – Python 3.8+

• GUI Development:  
 – Tkinter with ttk for theming and modern widget styling

• Database:
 – SQLite (using Python’s sqlite3 module; consider SQLite FTS for improved search performance)

• Security Libraries:  
 – cryptography (for AES/Fernet encryption and PBKDF2 key derivation)  
 – bcrypt or Argon2 for secure password hashing

• Additional Utilities:
 – Pillow for any image-related functionality (if required)

4. COMPONENT DESIGN & MODULE INTERACTION

[A] UI Module  
 – Handles user interactions and forwards actions (e.g., “create note”, “save note”, “search”) to the Controller.  
 – Implements responsive layouts via Tkinter’s grid/pack managers.  
 – Renders notifications and error messages.

[B] Controller / Business Logic Module  
 – Receives events from the UI, validates inputs, and coordinates with the persistence and security modules.  
 – Keeps the UI decoupled from the details of storage/encryption.

[C] Persistence Module  
 – Implements a wrapper around SQLite database calls, including connection management and transaction safety.  
 – Uses an abstraction layer that makes it easier to extend in the future (e.g., for cloud synchronization).

[D] Security Module  
 – Encrypts note content before the data is sent to the persistence layer.  
 – Decrypts note content when a note is retrieved.  
 – Handles login and password hashing routines to secure user sessions.

[E] JSON Import/Export Module  
 – Provides APIs to serialize/deserialize note objects.  
 – Interacts with the Controller for merging or exporting note data while handling errors (e.g., duplicate notes).

5. MAINTAINABILITY & FUTURE EXTENSIBILITY

• Adopt a clear modular structure (e.g., using MVC/MVP) to separate UI, logic, and persistence.
• Place configuration in external files (config.json/YAML) allowing runtime changes without code modifications.
• Document internal APIs and component interfaces to ease unit testing and integration testing.
• Design the Data Access Layer to allow eventual migration to a cloud-based storage solution.
• Keep security concerns (key management, encryption) modular to upgrade as best practices evolve.

 2. A Business Logic (Controller) Layer that handles core application workflows including note CRUD operations, search functionalities, and multi-user authentication.
 3. A Data Access Layer centered on SQLite for efficient, indexed data persistence with transaction safety and future extensibility.
 4. A Security Module that employs cryptography (AES/Fernet, PBKDF2) and robust password hashing (bcrypt/argon2) to secure sensitive data.
 5. An Import/Export Module dedicated to managing JSON file exchanges.

This layered design, paired with the selected Python-based technology stack, meets both the functional and non‑functional requirements while providing a clear path to maintenance and future feature enhancements.
