Below is a high-level system architecture design that covers the primary components, layers, and technology selections based on the provided specifications.

─────────────────────────  
1. Overall Architectural Style

The application is structured as a layered/MVC-like architecture that separates concerns into the following primary layers:

• User Interface Layer  
• Business Logic Layer  
• Data Access Layer  
• Security Modules (integrated across layers)  
• Configuration/Dependency Management

Each layer communicates with the adjacent layers via well-defined interfaces so that each component can be modified or extended independently.

─────────────────────────  
2. Component Design

A. User Interface Layer

• Role:  
 – Provides the graphical interface using Python’s Tkinter with ttk styling for a modern, cross-platform look.  
 – Manages user views/screens for note listing, note creation/editing, user login/registration, and settings.  
 – Handles immediate UI feedback (dialog pop-ups for deletion confirmations, import/export status, etc.).

• Key Components:  
 1. Main Application Window – container that holds and manages different views (note list, note editor, account/login views).  
 2. Note Editor View – supports Markdown input and rich text formatting. Future integration with a syntax highlighter (via a Python package for Tkinter, or a custom widget for code blocks).  
 3. Account & Authentication View – provides login UI, registration forms and basic session management.  
 4. Status & Modal Dialogs – for notifications, confirmations, and error messages.

• Technology:  
 – Python 3.9+  
 – Tkinter and ttk  
 – Custom widgets and possible third-party libraries for Markdown preview (if a lightweight webview or text widget update is acceptable).

B. Business Logic Layer

• Role:  
 – Implements application use cases (CRUD for notes, search, import/export, backup and restore).  
 – Coordinates with the Security Modules to handle encryption/decryption and authentication.  
 – Controls input validation, error handling, and session state management.

• Key Components:  
 1. Note Management Module – handles create, read, update, delete, search, tag/categorize notes, and interface with the data access layer.  
 2. Import/Export Module – implements JSON schema validation, data collisions, and mapping between internal models and JSON.  
 3. Formatting and Rendering Module – supports Markdown rendering and rich-text styling preview; encapsulates logic for toggling between raw Markdown and formatted view.  
 4. Session & User Services – processes login, multi-user session management, password hashing, and user-account isolated operations.

• Technology:  
 – Pure Python modules  
 – Standard libraries for JSON processing, datetime, etc.  
 – Third-party libraries for Markdown (such as Markdown or mistune) and rich text if needed.

C. Data Access Layer

• Role:  
 – Abstracts the persistence mechanism.  
 – Provides a set of CRUD operations against a local SQLite database that stores users, notes, and associated metadata.  
 – Ensures that standard queries and operations work seamlessly, even when note contents are encrypted.

• Key Components:  
 1. Database Connector – wraps Python’s sqlite3 module and provides connection pooling (if necessary) and transaction support.  
 2. DAO (Data Access Objects) – separate objects for User, Note, and Metadata for CRUD operations.  
 3. Migration/Schema Management – scripts and versioning for schema changes.

• Technology:  
 – SQLite (via Python’s sqlite3 library)  
 – SQLAlchemy (optional ORM) for abstraction if further extensibility is desired  
 – Dedicated modules for handling backup/restore via JSON

D. Security Modules

• Role:  
 – Provide authentication and encryption services for the system.  
 – Enforce security policies such as password hashing and note-level encryption without interfering with CRUD operations.

• Key Components:  
 1. Authentication Module – manages user login, registration, session handling.  
  – Utilizes robust password hashing algorithms (e.g., bcrypt or argon2).  
 2. Encryption Module – encapsulates logic for encrypting and decrypting note contents on a per-note basis.  
  – Leverages symmetric encryption (AES/Fernet) with keys derived via a key derivation function (KDF) from the user’s password.  
 3. Logging and Exception Handler – captures security exceptions, decryption failures, and logs errors without leaking sensitive details.  
 4. API Boundary – integrates with both business logic and data access to provide seamless encryption/decryption during standard operations.

• Technology:  
 – Cryptography library (e.g., cryptography.io for AES/Fernet)  
 – bcrypt or argon2 for password hashing

E. Configuration and Dependency Management

• Role:  
 – Provides centralized configuration via files (e.g., config.json or YAML) to store settings for UI, encryption keys, database paths, logging levels, etc.  
 – Manages external dependencies, ensuring installation consistency across platforms.

• Key Components:  
 1. Configuration Loader – module to read from JSON/YAML files upon startup.  
 2. Requirements File (requirements.txt) – lists all external dependencies (cryptography, Markdown, bcrypt/argon2, etc.).  
 3. Environment-specific Settings – allows separation of parameters between development and production environments.

• Technology:  
 – Python’s json, yaml libraries  
 – Standard pip management with a requirements.txt file

3. Technology Stack Summary

Language and Runtime:
 • Python 3.9 or higher

User Interface:
 • Tkinter and ttk (built into Python)  
 • Custom widgets for enhanced Markdown/rich text support

Persistence:
 • SQLite database (using Python’s sqlite3 module)  
 • Optionally, the SQLAlchemy ORM for more abstracted data access

Security:
 • cryptography library for AES/Fernet encryption  
 • bcrypt or argon2-cffi for secure password hashing

Utilities/Additional Libraries:
 • Markdown processing (e.g., Markdown, mistune)  
 • Syntax highlighting: a dedicated Python module or a Tkinter widget adaptation  
 • Logging: Python’s logging module  
 • Testing: unittest or pytest for unit/integration testing  
 • Packaging: PyInstaller or cx_Freeze for deployment

─────────────────────────  
4. Interactions Between Components

• The UI Layer calls functions in the Business Logic Layer to perform note creation, editing, deletion, and search operations.  
• The Business Logic Layer validates input and calls the Data Access Layer for persistent operations.  
• For encrypted notes, the Business Logic Layer invokes the Encryption Module before saving data to SQLite and decrypts notes when retrieving.  
• The Authentication Module is used whenever a user logs in or creates an account, ensuring each user’s session is managed and that operations respect account isolation.  
• The Import/Export Module works closely with both the Data Access Layer and Business Logic Layer to verify JSON content against the schema before data integration.

─────────────────────────  
5. Deployment and Testing Considerations

Deployment:
 • Use PyInstaller (or a similar tool) to package the application into standalone executables for Windows, macOS, and Linux.  
 • Prepare cross-platform install documentation detailing system-specific dependencies (especially for Tkinter on Linux).  
 • Maintain versioned configurations and schema migrations to support future extension.

Testing:
 • Unit tests for individual business logic functions (CRUD, encryption/decryption, import/export).  
 • Integration tests to simulate end-to-end flows (user login, note operations, backup/restore).  
 • Lightweight GUI testing, perhaps via automated scripts or manual testing frameworks designed for Tkinter.  
 • Security tests to ensure edge cases such as password resets or decryption failures are handled gracefully.

─────────────────────────  
6. Final Summary

This high-level system architecture employs a well-separated layered design:

• UI Layer (Tkinter/ttk for views)  
• Business Logic Layer (handling notes and user operations)  
• Data Access Layer (via SQLite)  
• Dedicated Security Modules (managing password hashing and note encryption)  
• A central configuration management system

The chosen technology stack (Python 3.9+, SQLite, cryptography libraries, and Tkinter) meets the requirements for portability, usability, security, and maintainability. This modular, clear separation ensures that future enhancements—such as cloud synchronization, advanced rich text editing, or multi-device support—can be integrated with minimal restructuring.

This architecture, along with the phased development plan, forms the blueprint for a robust, secure, and user-friendly local note-taking application.
