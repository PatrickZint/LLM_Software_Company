Below is a refined set of requirements derived from the original goals. This enhanced specification clarifies functionality, defines acceptance criteria, and outlines non-functional aspects to guide design, development, and testing.

──────────────────────────────
1. Overall Objective

• Develop a lightweight news reader application that retrieves the latest top headlines from a public news API and displays them to the user via a simple graphical interface.
• The application must provide a responsive user interface that caters to both mobile and desktop contexts (if applicable) without introducing unnecessary complexity.

──────────────────────────────
2. Functional Requirements

2.1. Data Retrieval and API Integration

 • The application shall connect to a public news API (e.g., NewsAPI.org or another service).  
  – It shall support configuration of the API endpoint and key through an external configuration file.  
  – The configuration file (e.g., JSON, YAML) must allow administrators or developers to update the endpoint, API key, and other related parameters without changing the source code.  

 • The system shall fetch the top headlines upon application startup and periodically thereafter (if applicable).  
  – Define a “refresh interval” (e.g., every 15 minutes) configurable by the admin or user.  

 • In case of a failed API request (due to network issues, API downtime, or a bad response), the application shall display a clear error message and provide a retry option.

2.2. Home Screen and Basic User Interface

 • The home screen shall display a scrollable list of news headlines. Each list item should include at minimum:  
  – The title of the article  
  – A thumbnail image (if provided by the API)  
  – A brief snippet or summary (optionally, based on available API data)  
  – The publication date/time in a human-readable form  

 • The list shall support pull-to-refresh or a refresh button to allow users to update headlines on-demand.

2.3. Detail View for News Articles

 • Tapping or clicking on a news item from the list shall navigate the user to a detailed view.  
  – The detail view shall include the full article details such as: title, full text or extended summary, images (if available), and publication date/time.  
  – If the article content is not fully available via the API, include a “Read more” option that opens the full article in an in-app web viewer or external browser.

2.4. Configuration Files

 • The project shall include configuration files to manage settings like API endpoints, API keys, refresh intervals, and other relevant parameters.  
  – The configuration format should be well documented (e.g., config.json or config.yaml) and easily editable.

──────────────────────────────
3. Non-functional Requirements

3.1. Performance and Responsiveness
 • The application must remain responsive when fetching data.  
  – Network calls should be asynchronous to avoid UI blocking.  
  – Cache previously retrieved headlines for quick access during brief offline periods.

3.2. Usability and Design
 • The UI shall be minimalistic and intuitive, with a focus on ease of reading and navigation.  
  – Usability best practices must be followed, ensuring readability (e.g., legible fonts, proper color contrast).  
  – The layout should adapt gracefully to different screen sizes and orientations.

3.3. Portability and Lightweight Design
 • The application must possess a small footprint, meaning minimal reliance on heavy external libraries.  
  – The overall design should emphasize performance and low resource consumption.

3.4. Reliability and Error Handling
 • Robust error handling must be implemented for API calls, parsing responses, and network exceptions.  
  – The system must provide informative error messages to aid user troubleshooting.

3.5. Maintainability
 • Source code must be modular and well-documented to facilitate future enhancements or fixes.  
  – Follow established coding standards, and include inline comments and documentation for critical sections.

4. Acceptance Criteria

• On launching the application, a list of top headlines appears on the home screen with the required components (title, image, snippet, date/time).  
• Selecting a headline transitions the display to a detailed view showing extended article content or a "Read more" link if the full text is unavailable.  
• In the event of an error during data fetch, an appropriate error message is displayed with an option to retry.  
• Configuration files are present and can be modified to change API endpoints, API keys, and refresh interval settings without altering the application logic.  
• The application remains responsive during network calls and displays a loading indicator as needed.

──────────────────────────────
5. Additional Considerations

• Security: Ensure that sensitive information such as API keys is managed securely in configuration files and not exposed in the source code repository.  
• Testing: Provide unit tests for critical business logic (e.g., data parsing, error handling) and integration tests to validate API communication and UI navigation.  
• Future Extensibility: Consider a modular design that allows for new features, such as multiple news categories or localization support, to be added with minimal refactoring.

Summary

This refined requirement document aims to provide clarity on both the high-level goals and detailed needs for the lightweight news reader application. By distinguishing between functional and non-functional aspects and laying out clear acceptance criteria, the development team should have a solid basis for design, implementation, and testing.
