Legend:
• UI Module – Provides dialogs, displays, configuration panels, and progress/error notifications.
• Core API – Manages application logic, acting as an orchestrator that coordinates requests from the UI to the image processing, configuration, and export modules.
• Image Processing Module – Uses Pillow for initial image handling and OpenCV for pixel-level comparison, applying tolerance values and generating annotated “diff” images.
• Configuration Module – Parses external config files (JSON, YAML, or XML), provides application settings (default tolerance, theme, export directory) to other modules, and listens for dynamic changes.
• Export Module – Handles validations (such as file permissions) and saving the generated diff image to user-specified directories.
• Database Module – Optionally persists user preferences, usage logs, or past comparisons using the embedded SQLite3 database.

2. COMPONENT DESIGN DETAILS

A. UI Module  
   • Purpose: Provide a user-friendly graphical interface for loading images, displaying side-by-side and diff views, adjusting tolerance, and saving outputs.
   • Technologies:
     – GUI Framework: PyQt5 or PySide2 (for advanced features and cross-platform consistency) or Tkinter for simpler UIs.
     – Standard dialogs for file selection, notifications, and error messages.
     – Asynchronous or multi-threaded operations (using Python’s threading or async modules) to keep the UI responsive while processing images.
   • Responsibilities:
     – Render input and output panels.
     – Accept user input (file selections, tolerance adjustments).
     – Display progress notifications and error dialogue boxes.
     – Relay UI events to the Core API for further processing.

B. Core API / Application Logic Layer  
   • Purpose: Serve as the mediator that handles business logic and routes data between UI and backend components.
   • Responsibilities:
     – Accept image file paths and tolerance values from the UI.
     – Validate configuration settings and pass them to modules.
     – Coordinate the sequence: input validation → image loading → processing → diff generation → file export.
     – Utilize observer/callback mechanisms to update the UI with progress or error updates.
   • Technology: Regular Python modules structured using a Model–View–Controller (MVC) or Model–View–Presenter (MVP) pattern to decouple concerns.

C. Image Processing Module  
   • Purpose: Execute image file I/O, validate inputs, perform pixel-by-pixel comparison and annotate differences.
   • Technologies:
     – Pillow (as the initial image loading and basic manipulation library).
     – OpenCV (for optimized pixel comparisons and drawing annotations).
   • Design:
     – Separate functions for file loading, dimension matching (including prompting for cropping/resizing when needed), and tolerance-based pixel comparisons.
     – Modular design to allow later substitution of enhanced algorithms.
   • Integration:
     – Provides an interface that accepts two image objects and returns an annotated diff image as a Pillow or OpenCV image.
     – Uses conversion routines between Pillow images and OpenCV arrays as needed.

D. Configuration Management Module  
   • Purpose: Load and manage user/application settings.
   • Technologies:
     – Python’s built-in JSON or PyYAML libraries for parsing external configuration files.
     – Optional: XML parsing if XML configuration is chosen.
   • Responsibilities:
     – Read default settings (tolerance, export directory, UI theme) at startup.
     – Provide APIs for runtime queries/modifications (in the event of dynamic configuration changes).
     – Persist changes gracefully (if immediate changes are supported).
  
E. Export and File Management Module  
   • Purpose: Write out the diff image to a user-specified directory and format.
   • Technologies:
     – Standard Python file I/O.
     – Integration with Pillow/OpenCV to save images in PNG/JPEG.
   • Responsibilities:
     – Validate destination paths and file system permissions.
     – Provide confirmation or error messages to the Core API based on export success or failure.
  
F. Database Module (Optional)  
   • Purpose: Manage persistent state such as user preferences, logs, and historical comparisons.
   • Technology:
     – SQLite3 (via Python’s built-in library) for lightweight persistence.
   • Responsibilities:
     – Define a lightweight schema.
     – Provide APIs for logging usage events or saving user-specific settings.
     – Use migration strategies for future enhancements.

3. TECHNOLOGY STACK SELECTION

Language and Runtime:
   – Python 3.8 or newer (ensures compatibility with modern libraries and cross-platform support).

Core Image Libraries:
   – Pillow (e.g., version 9.x) for image loading and basic I/O.
   – OpenCV (e.g., opencv-python 4.x and optionally opencv-contrib-python) for advanced image processing tasks.

GUI Framework:
   – Primary Recommendation: PyQt5/PySide2 for a rich, cross-platform GUI experience.
   – Alternatively: Tkinter for a simpler interface if execution simplicity is desired.

Configuration and Parsing:
   – Python’s json module or PyYAML for handling JSON or YAML config files.
   – Consider xml.etree.ElementTree if XML configuration is required.

Persistence (Optional):
   – SQLite3 via Python’s built-in sqlite3 module for persistence of user settings and logs.

Dependency Management:
   – Virtual Environments: Use venv, virtualenv, or Conda for environment isolation.
   – Package Management: Use a requirements.txt file or tools like Pipenv/Poetry to lock dependency versions.

Testing and CI:
   – Unit Testing Frameworks: pytest or unittest.
   – Continuous Integration: GitHub Actions, Travis CI, or similar CI platforms for automated testing on multiple OS environments.

4. MODULE INTERACTION AND DATA FLOW

1. User launches the application (UI Module).  
2. From the UI, the user selects two images using file dialogs.  
3. The UI calls the Core API with these file paths and any configured tolerance value (fetched via the Configuration Module).  
4. The Core API initiates the image processing workflow in the Image Processing Module:  
 a. The module uses Pillow to load the images and check compatibility.  
 b. If dimensions mismatch, the UI is prompted via a callback mechanism.  
 c. OpenCV performs pixel-by-pixel comparison and generates the annotated diff image based on the tolerance parameter.
5. The ready diff image is passed back to the Core API, which then instructs the UI to display it in a dedicated panel.
6. When the user opts to save the diff image, the UI calls the Export Module with the chosen output path and required format.
7. The Export Module validates permissions and saves the file, returning success or error status to the Core API.
8. Throughout the process, logging and error handling (optionally recorded using the Database Module) ensure that messages are available for debugging and user notifications.

──────────────────────────────────────────────  
5. FUTURE EXPANSIONS

• The modular design allows simple substitution of the image processing algorithm or expanding the UI with new features (such as batch processing).  
• The Database Module can later be extended to store more detailed logs or usage analytics without impacting core functionality.  
• Adding new image formats, additional configuration file types, or even enhanced comparison strategies can be achieved by extending the existing modules while maintaining clear interfaces for integration.

CONCLUSION

This high-level system architecture divides the application into clearly defined modules:

– A UI Module for cross-platform user interactions using PyQt5/PySide2 (or Tkinter as an alternative).  
– A Core API layer that orchestrates interactions between the UI and back-end functions.  
– A robust Image Processing Module leveraging Pillow and OpenCV for pixel-accurate comparisons.  
– A Configuration Management module for dynamically loading and managing application settings.  
– An Export Module for handling file saving with proper validations.  
– An optional Database Module for lightweight persistence via SQLite3.

The selected technology stack (Python 3.8+, Pillow, OpenCV, PyQt/PySide or Tkinter, and SQLite3) ensures that the solution is cross-platform, modular, maintainable, and extensible enough to meet both current and future requirements.

This architecture provides a clear blueprint for developers to implement a scalable, maintainable solution while keeping the user experience simple and intuitive.
