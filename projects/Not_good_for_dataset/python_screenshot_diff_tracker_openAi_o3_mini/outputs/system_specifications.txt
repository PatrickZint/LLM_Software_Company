Below is a comprehensive system specification document that translates the refined goals and environmental constraints into detailed requirements and design recommendations.

──────────────────────────────────────────────
1. OVERVIEW

1.1. Product Vision  
• Develop a cross-platform desktop application for comparing two screenshots.  
• Provide a user-friendly graphical interface to load, compare, and export annotated diff images with pixel-level accuracy.

1.2. Scope  
• Accept two image files (PNG, JPEG, BMP).  
• Process images on a pixel-by-pixel basis, with configurable tolerance for minor differences.  
• Visually mark differences on an automatically generated “diff image.”  
• Offer a UI for easy navigation, parameter configuration (such as sensitivity), and exporting the resulting image.  
• Include configuration and settings management via external files (JSON, YAML, or XML), and use SQLite3 if lightweight persistence is required (e.g., for storing usage logs or user settings).

──────────────────────────────────────────────
2. FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

2.1. Image Input  
– FR-1: File Selection and Validation  
 • The application shall allow users to choose exactly two image files via standard file dialogs.  
 • Supported formats include PNG, JPEG, and BMP.  
 • The system shall verify readability and compatibility, and display a clear error message if an unsupported or corrupted image is provided.

2.2. Image Comparison and Difference Detection  
– FR-2: Pixel-by-Pixel Comparison  
 • Compare the two images on a pixel level. For each pixel, compare color values (and alpha if present) using a configurable tolerance value.  
 • If the two images have different dimensions, prompt the user with options either to:  
  – Crop/resize to the same dimensions, or  
  – Abort the operation with a detailed error message describing the mismatch.

– FR-3: Generating the Annotated Diff Image  
 • Create a resultant image that highlights differences using a clearly contrasting color (e.g., red outlines or overlays on regions where pixels differ).  
 • Allow the user to control sensitivity through a tolerance parameter, configurable via the UI and/or configuration file.  
 • The algorithm must be modular to allow substitution of advanced image processing techniques in future releases.

2.3. User Interface (UI)  
– FR-4: GUI Features  
 • Implement an intuitive UI that includes:
  – File selection dialogs for choosing the two input images.
  – Side-by-side display of the original images plus an additional panel for the generated diff image.
  – Progress indicators, notifications, and error dialogs to inform users via real-time feedback.
  – Controls for adjusting the tolerance/sensitivity for image comparison.
 • Use a cross-platform GUI framework (e.g., Tkinter, PyQt, or wxPython) to ensure consistent behavior on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

2.4. Exporting Diff Images  
– FR-5: Saving the Diff Image  
 • The application shall allow users to export the diff image by choosing an output directory using standard file dialogs.  
 • Support output formats (e.g., PNG, JPEG) with an option provided if feasible.  
 • Provide clear confirmation messages on successful saves or clear error notifications in case of permission issues or file system errors.

2.5. Configuration Files and Settings  
– FR-6: Configurable Settings Management  
 • Provide and parse a default configuration file (e.g., config.json, config.yaml, or config.xml) that includes:
  – Default tolerance settings.
  – Default export directory.
  – UI appearance and theme.
 • Allow advanced users to modify these settings to tailor the application’s behavior.  
 • Changes in configuration files should be applied either immediately or upon restarting the application, as appropriate.

3. NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

3.1. Usability  
• The UI must be intuitive and accessible to non-technical users, with clear tooltips, labels, and logically grouped controls.  
• Navigation should be simple, minimizing the number of steps required to perform a screenshot comparison.

3.2. Performance  
• The image comparison operation should complete promptly for common resolutions up to 1920×1080.  
• The application must manage memory efficiently so as not to incur excessive overhead, particularly when dealing with large image files.  
• Consider asynchronous processing or background threading to ensure the UI remains responsive during computation-intensive tasks.

3.3. Compatibility  
• Target a cross-platform solution with support for Windows, macOS, and Linux.  
• Ensure all selected libraries and frameworks (e.g., Pillow, OpenCV, and the chosen GUI toolkit) are compatible with the target operating systems.

3.4. Maintainability and Configurability  
• The overall codebase should use a modular design (see Section 4 for further design recommendations) so that adding new features (e.g., batch processing or new image formats) is straightforward.  
• Include comprehensive documentation for both end-users (how to operate the tool) and developers (code structure, configuration, and maintenance).

3.5. Error Handling and Logging  
• All errors (e.g., file I/O errors, format mismatches, and processing exceptions) must result in clear user notifications via dialogs.  
• Log errors and events to a file or console to aid debugging without causing ungraceful application crashes.

4. SYSTEM DESIGN RECOMMENDATIONS

4.1. Modular Architecture  
Organize the application into clearly defined modules:  
 A. UI Module  
  • Responsible for rendering the interface and managing user interactions.  
  • Components: File dialogs, image displays, configuration panels, status/progress bars, and notifications.  
  • Recommended frameworks: Tkinter (for simplicity) or PyQt/Qt for advanced UI features.

 B. Image Processing Module  
  • Handles image loading, validation, and pixel-by-pixel comparison.  
  • Separates responsibilities between:
   – Using Pillow for initial image loading, basic manipulations, and format conversion.
   – Using OpenCV for high-performance pixel comparisons and detection of differences.
  • Implement the algorithm such that the tolerance parameter is easily configurable and that it supports future enhancements.

 C. Export and File Management Module  
  • Manage saving of output images.  
  • Validate write permissions and file naming, and provide user feedback on operation success/failure.

 D. Configuration Management Module  
  • Loads, applies, and (optionally) persists user and system settings from/to a configuration file.  
  • Provide an API for both UI components and processing modules to access current settings.

 E. Database Access Module (Optional)  
  • If persisting user preferences, usage logs, or historical comparisons is required, use SQLite3.  
  • Define a lightweight schema with appropriate migrations if future expansions are envisaged.

4.2. Interaction Between Modules  
• Use clearly defined interfaces between the UI, processing, export, and configuration modules to ensure loose coupling.  
• For instance, the UI Component calls the image processing function with the required parameters received from the configuration module.  
• Apply observer or callback patterns to update the UI based on processing events (e.g., progress updates or completion).

4.3. Library Integration  
• Clearly define roles:
 – Pillow will be used for image file I/O (loading images into memory) and basic manipulations supporting various formats.
 – OpenCV will perform advanced detection, pixel comparison, and annotate diff images.
• Ensure that conversion routines between Pillow’s image objects and OpenCV array formats are implemented where necessary.

4.4. Dependency and Environment Management  
• Develop using Python 3.8 or newer.  
• Create a requirements.txt (or use Pipenv/Poetry) listing:
 – Pillow (e.g., version 9.x)
 – OpenCV (e.g., opencv-python 4.x) [and opencv-contrib-python if additional modules are required]
• Document the process of setting up a virtual environment using venv, virtualenv, or conda.  
• Use Continuous Integration (CI) to run tests and verify installation on the supported operating systems.

4.5. Testing Strategy  
• Unit Tests:
 – Test image loading, file format validation, and error handling.
 – Validate the pixel comparison algorithm with known inputs and tolerance settings.
 – Ensure configuration file parsing works and that invalid or missing parameters are handled gracefully.
• Integration Tests:
 – Simulate complete use cases: load images through the UI, run a comparison, and export the diff image.
 – Automate tests using frameworks such as pytest.
• CI Pipeline:
 – Establish CI pipelines that install dependencies, run unit/integration tests, and verify that cross-platform builds succeed.

Steps:  
 1. Launch the application.  
 2. Use the file dialog to select two screenshot images.  
 3. The application validates and displays both images side-by-side.  
 4. The image processing module performs pixel-by-pixel comparison based on current tolerance settings.  
 5. The diff image is generated, highlighting differences with a noticeable color overlay.  
 6. The user exports the diff image to a chosen directory via the export interface.

6.2. Modify Comparison Sensitivity  
Actor: Advanced user  
Steps:  
 1. Open the configuration panel or edit the configuration file directly.  
 2. Adjust the tolerance setting to either increase or decrease sensitivity of the comparison.  
 3. Run a new comparison to verify that changes in sensitivity are reflected in the diff image output.

7. FUTURE CONSIDERATIONS AND EXPANSION

• Future releases could add advanced comparison options (e.g., comparing layout differences or UI element changes) without affecting the core pixel-level comparison logic.  
• Consider adding batch processing capabilities for comparing multiple image pairs with minimal UI changes by reusing and extending the current modular components.  
• Log versioning for configuration settings and requirements can support traceability and evolving user needs.
