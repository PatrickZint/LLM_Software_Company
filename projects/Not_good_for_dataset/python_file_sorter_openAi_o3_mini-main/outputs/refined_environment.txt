Below is an analysis of the constraints along with recommendations for refining and clarifying them.

──────────────────────────────
1. Performance Requirement

Current statement:
  • “The system must provide a reasonable performance.”

Issues:
  • “Reasonable performance” is ambiguous.
  • It does not define any measurable performance targets (e.g., response time, throughput, resource usage).
  • There’s no indication of the expected load or usage scenario.

Recommendations:
  • Define quantifiable performance metrics. For example:
    – Average response time (e.g., “Under typical load, 95% of operations must complete within 200 ms”).
   – Maximum acceptable latency for key operations (e.g., “Database queries and file operations should finish within X seconds under a given load”).
   – Throughput targets (e.g., “The system must handle X transactions per second under normal operating conditions”).
  • Consider performance testing scenarios:
    – What is a “typical” load, and what constitutes a “peak” load?
    – Any expected concurrency or parallel processing?
  • In the context of using Python and SQLite:
    – Recognize that SQLite works best for low to moderate concurrent accesses. Document the expected access patterns.
    – If high write concurrency or heavy read patterns are expected, define how the system will mitigate SQLite limitations (e.g., using caching, read replicas, or controlled access patterns).

Example refinement:
  • “Under typical usage scenarios, 95% of all system operations (e.g., file and database transactions) must complete within 200 milliseconds. The system should sustain X concurrent users without significant performance degradation.”

2. Technology Stack: Python, SQLite3, and Standard Library (os, shutil)

Current statement:
  • “Technology stack: Use Python, SQLite3, and the standard library (os, shutil).”

Concerns and Considerations:
  • Python Version:
    – Specify which version of Python is targeted (e.g., Python 3.10+). This avoids issues with deprecated functions or incompatible features.
  • SQLite3:
    – Ensure that SQLite3 is the appropriate solution given the anticipated access and data volume. Document its limitations (e.g., single-writer restrictions) and the anticipated use cases.
  • Standard Library Modules:
    – Using only os and shutil might be sufficient for file operations, but clarify if any additional modules might be needed in the future for logging, threading, or network operations.
  • Dependencies and Environment:
    – Confirm that the system will run on operating systems where these standard libraries behave consistently (e.g., differences in os or shutil behavior between Windows and Unix-like systems).
  • Development, Testing, and Deployment Environment:
    – Define if the environment is expected to be containerized (with Docker) or run on a specific OS version for consistency.

Example refinement:
  • “The system will be developed in Python (version 3.10 or later) using SQLite3 for data persistence. The file operations will be restricted to the functionalities provided by the os and shutil modules from the Python standard library. It is assumed that the deployment environment supports these libraries without platform-specific issues. Consider evaluating SQLite3’s performance under expected concurrent loads and planning for alternative solutions if future requirements exceed its capabilities.”

Summing Up

Refined Requirements (Draft Example):

1. Performance:
  • The system shall complete 95% of all operations (database and file system interactions) within 200 milliseconds under typical load.
  • The system shall support up to X concurrent users/transactions before performance degradation occurs.
  • Regular performance testing must be conducted to validate these thresholds and ensure smooth scalability.

2. Technology Stack:
  • The implementation will use Python 3.10+.
  • SQLite3 will be used as the primary data storage solution. As SQLite3 is optimized for low to moderate concurrent usage, anticipated usage patterns shall be documented, and performance mitigations planned if necessary.
  • All file and operating system interactions will be implemented using the os and shutil modules from the Python standard library.
  • The development and deployment environments must be capable of running the specified Python version and support consistent behaviors of os and shutil across platforms.

This refined set of requirements provides clearer guidance to developers regarding performance expectations and defines the technology stack more precisely, ensuring that both design and testing phases have clear benchmarks and expectations.
