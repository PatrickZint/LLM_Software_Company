Below is a high-level system architecture that meets the provided specifications. This design breaks the application into modular components, defines interactions between layers, and maps each component to a recommended technology or library. The architecture follows a layered, modular, and event-driven approach to ensure responsiveness, scalability, and ease of future extension.

──────────────────────────────────────────────  
1. OVERALL ARCHITECTURE  
──────────────────────────────────────────────  
The architecture is organized into three primary layers:

A. Presentation Layer (GUI)  
 • Implements the user-facing interface (configuration, monitoring, control, and report export).  
 • Employs an MVC (Model–View–Controller) or similar pattern to decouple UI concerns from core logic.  

B. Business Logic Layer  
 • Centralized services for file monitoring, sorting, and logging.  
 • Implements rule evaluation (file type, creation date) and orchestrates file operations reliably (atomic moves & error handling).  
 • Manages asynchronous and concurrent processing (background threads, event handling).  

C. Data Access Layer  
 • Handles all interactions with the SQLite3 database and external JSON/YAML configuration files.  
 • Provides APIs for logging operations and for saving/loading configuration settings.

──────────────────────────────────────────────  
2. COMPONENT DESIGN  
──────────────────────────────────────────────  
Below is a breakdown of key components and their responsibilities:

A. File Monitoring Component  
 • Monitors one or more user-specified directories.  
 • Utilizes a file system monitoring library (e.g., watchdog) that abstracts OS-specific APIs (inotify for Linux, ReadDirectoryChangesW for Windows).  
 • Supports fallback polling mode if advanced notification APIs are unavailable.  
 • Runs on a dedicated background thread or uses asynchronous loops to continuously detect creation/modification events.  
 • Reports file events to the File Processing Service.

B. File Processing & Sorting Service  
 • Receives file events from the monitoring component.  
 • Evaluates applicable sorting rules (by file extension or creation date) based on current configuration.  
 • Validates that destination directories exist (or creates them dynamically) and moves files using atomic operations (using os and shutil modules).  
 • Ensures integrity by handling any exceptions and reverting partial changes if errors occur.

C. Logging Service  
 • Captures details of every file movement, including source, destination, timestamp, and applied rule.  
 • Stores log data into the SQLite3 database using parameterized queries and transactions to handle concurrency.  
 • Exposes querying interfaces for report generation and debugging.
 • Provides additional logging of errors and anomalous events as either separate logs or within the same database (using severity markers).

D. CSV Report Export Module  
 • Provides functionality to generate CSV files from logged data.  
 • Accepts filter options (date ranges, file type/sorting rule filters) via the UI.  
 • Reads from the SQLite database and writes CSV reports with appropriate header rows and proper data escaping.

E. Configuration Manager  
 • Loads and writes settings stored in user-friendly external files (JSON or YAML).  
 • Manages monitored directory settings, sorting rule definitions, and logging preferences.  
 • Notifies the Business Logic layer immediately when configuration changes occur so that rule updates take effect instantly.

F. GUI / Presentation Component  
 • Implements interactive screens for:
  – Configuring directories, sorting rules, and logging settings  
  – Monitoring real-time system status (file events, recent operations, error notifications)  
  – Displaying and filtering logs  
  – Manually triggering organization or CSV exports  
 • Provides notifications (pop-ups or status messages) for errors and system events.
 • Uses a framework that supports cross-platform interfaces and ease-of-use.

──────────────────────────────────────────────  
3. TECHNOLOGY STACK SELECTION  
──────────────────────────────────────────────  
Below is the recommended technology stack for each aspect of the application:

• Programming Language:  
 – Python 3.10 or later, ensuring modern language features and better async support.

• GUI Framework (Presentation Layer):  
 – PyQt or PySide2/6 (preferred for rich, native cross-platform look and feel)  
 – Alternatively, Tkinter could be used for a simpler UI if needed.

• File System Monitoring:  
 – watchdog Python library which abstracts across Linux, macOS, and Windows.  
 – Custom fallback polling mechanism if advanced OS monitoring is not available.

• File Operations:  
 – Python’s built-in os and shutil modules, ensuring cross-platform compatibility and reliable file manipulation.

• Database (Data Access Layer):  
 – SQLite3 (embedded database)  
 – Use Python’s sqlite3 module (with careful transaction handling and potential connection pooling, if necessary).

• Configuration Management:  
 – JSON or YAML configuration files  
 – Use Python’s json module or an external library such as PyYAML for YAML support.

• Concurrency/Asynchronous Processing:  
 – Python’s threading module for multi-threaded file monitoring and database operations or  
 – Asyncio library for asynchronous processing, if the design evolves to require broader async patterns.

• Logging:  
 – Python’s standard logging module to manage error logs, operational logs, and debugging outputs.  
 – Configure logging handlers to write to both console and a dedicated error log file (or within SQLite in a separate table).

• Packaging and Deployment:  
 – PyInstaller to create standalone executables across platforms.  
 – Alternatively, Docker containers can be used for consistent environment deployments (particularly in Linux or containerized environments).

──────────────────────────────────────────────  
4. CONCURRENCY & ASYNCHRONOUS DESIGN  
──────────────────────────────────────────────  
• The file monitoring component runs in its own background thread or within an asynchronous event loop, ensuring that the GUI remains responsive.  
• File processing (sorting/moving) executes concurrently, with careful locking and exception handling to prevent race conditions.  
• Database write operations leverage transactions and parameterized queries to mitigate SQLite’s concurrency limitations.  
• The configuration manager can signal changes to the business logic layer dynamically, ensuring that rules are applied immediately.

──────────────────────────────────────────────  
5. DEPLOYMENT & EXTENSIBILITY  
──────────────────────────────────────────────  
• The installer script/package will check for Python 3.10+, required libraries (watchdog, PyQt/Tkinter, PyYAML if needed), and the presence of SQLite.  
• The modular design (separating monitoring, file operations, logging, and configuration) allows for easy extension:
 – New sorting rules can be added using plugin-like architecture.
 – Alternative logging/storage providers can be integrated with minimal changes.
 – The UI can be updated independently of core business logic.
• Comprehensive documentation (user manual, developer documentation, inline comments) is maintained to ease future enhancements.

7. CONCLUSION  
──────────────────────────────────────────────  
This high-level architecture ensures:

 – Clear separation of concerns via a layered design (Presentation, Business Logic, Data Access).  
 – Responsiveness by leveraging background threading or asynchronous operations for file monitoring and file processing.  
 – Reliability through proper error handling, logging, and robust file move operations.  
 – Extensibility by keeping configuration, sorting, and reporting modules loosely coupled and easily replaceable.  
 – Cross-platform support by using Python’s standard libraries and popular third-party libraries (watchdog and PyQt/Tkinter).

This blueprint lays the foundation for phased implementation and testing, aligning with the performance targets, configurability, and scalability mentioned in the system specifications.
