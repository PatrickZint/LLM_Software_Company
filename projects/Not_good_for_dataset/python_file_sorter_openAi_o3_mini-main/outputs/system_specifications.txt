Below is a comprehensive set of system specifications based on the refined goals and environment profile. This document defines the functional and non-functional requirements, as well as system design recommendations for the automated file organizer application.

──────────────────────────────
1. OVERVIEW

1.1. Purpose  
 This application is designed to automatically monitor one or more user-specified directories, sort new or modified files into folders (based on file type or creation date), log every file movement into a persistent SQLite database, and allow users to export log reports as CSV files. A friendly, intuitive graphical interface (GUI) will be provided for configuration, monitoring, and control.

1.2. Scope  
 • Monitor and process file system events (file creation, modification) in designated directories.  
 • Sort files into organized folder structures using configurable rules.  
 • Log each file operation with metadata (original path, new destination, timestamp, rule applied).  
 • Provide CSV export functionality with configurable filters.  
 • Enable users to adjust monitored directories, modify sorting rules, and view logs via a GUI.  
 • Use Python 3.10+ and SQLite3, with file operations covered by the standard os and shutil libraries.

──────────────────────────────
2. FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

2.1. Directory Monitoring  
 • The application shall let the user define one or more directories for monitoring through the GUI as well as via external configuration files (JSON or YAML).  
 • It shall continuously monitor these directories for the creation or modification of files.  
  – Use OS-level file monitoring APIs (e.g., inotify on Linux, ReadDirectoryChangesW on Windows) or reliable polling mechanisms if necessary.  
 • In cases of temporary disconnections or access errors (e.g., permission issues), the application shall:
  – Log these events in an error log.
  – Notify the user via the UI with appropriate error messages or alerts.
 • The monitoring service must be capable of handling directories with a large number of files without significant performance degradation.

2.2. File Sorting and Organization  
 • The system shall automatically move newly detected files to designated folders as defined by sorting rules.
 • Sorting Rules (configurable via GUI and external configuration):
  – File type: Detect by extensions (e.g., .jpg, .pdf) and move files into type-specific folders.
  – Creation date: Group files by date (year/month/day) within the target directory.
 • Users shall be able to add, remove, or modify sorting rules. The system should immediately adopt rule changes without needing to restart the application.
 • Before moving files, ensure:
  – The destination folder exists, or create it dynamically in a collision-free and consistent manner.
  – File integrity is maintained (no partial transfers, and use atomic operations where possible).

2.3. Logging File Movements  
 • Every file movement operation must be logged with the following attributes:
  – Original file path
  – Destination folder/path
  – Timestamp of the operation
  – The sorting rule applied (e.g., “File Type: jpg”, “Creation Date: 2023/10/05”)
 • Log entries will be stored persistently in an SQLite3 database.
  – Design the database schema so that it can be easily extended in the future (e.g., to include file size, user information, etc.).
 • All logging operations should correctly handle concurrent access patterns given SQLite’s limitations (using appropriate transaction management).

2.4. CSV Report Export  
 • The application shall provide a feature to export log data as CSV files.
 • Users must have options to filter the logs before export. Filtering options include:
  – Date range filters (start date and end date).
  – Sorting rule/type filters.
 • The CSV file shall follow a defined schema that matches the log database fields. The file should be formatted so that it can be imported easily into spreadsheet applications (e.g., Excel, LibreOffice).

2.5. User Interface (UI)  
 • Develop an intuitive and responsive GUI that supports:
  – Configuration screens for setting monitored directories, sorting rules, and logging preferences.
  – Real-time display of the system status (e.g., active monitoring, last file movement, error notifications).
  – A log summary display with options to search, filter, or sort logged operations.
  – Manual controls to trigger file organization or to generate and save CSV reports.
  – Notifications (e.g., pop-up alerts) for errors such as file access issues, failed moves, or database write errors.
 • All configuration changes made via the UI must be saved to external configuration files (JSON/YAML) to ensure persistence across sessions.

──────────────────────────────
3. NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

3.1. Performance and Scalability  
 • Performance targets:
  – Under typical load, 95% of all file system and database operations (e.g., file moves, database writes, and queries) should complete within 200 milliseconds.
  – The system must efficiently handle directories containing large numbers of files.
 • Concurrency:
  – The design should minimize interference with normal directory usage by utilizing background threads or asynchronous routines for file monitoring and database operations.
 • Regular performance testing must be conducted to validate operation latencies and to monitor resource usage under different scenarios.

3.2. Configurability and Extensibility  
 • All application configurations (monitored directories, sorting rules, logging preferences) shall be stored in human-readable external configuration files (e.g., JSON or YAML).  
 • The architecture must be modular:
  – Allow new sorting strategies or logging mechanisms to be integrated with minimal changes to the core logic.
  – Use design patterns (e.g., plugin pattern for sorting rules) to facilitate future extensions.
 • Clearly document configuration file syntax and permissible parameter values.

3.3. Reliability and Error Handling  
 • The application shall:
  – Include robust error handling mechanisms for handling issues like file access conflicts, disk errors, or database write failures.
  – Log errors and anomalies in a separate error log file or within the same SQLite database with high severity markers.
  – Recover gracefully from temporary issues, such as lost directory connection, without requiring user intervention.
 • Exceptions must be caught and detailed error messages should be provided both in logs and via the UI to aid in troubleshooting.

3.4. Security  
 • Ensure file operations align with the user’s permission settings:
  – Verify read/write permissions before accessing or moving files.
  – Handle any permission errors gracefully.
 • Protect configuration files and the SQLite database:
  – Consider file-system level permissions and possibly encryption if sensitive information is stored.
  – The application configuration and log files should be inaccessible to unauthorized users.
 • Ensure that any external libraries or dependencies are kept up-to-date with security patches.

──────────────────────────────
4. SYSTEM DESIGN RECOMMENDATIONS

4.1. Overall Architecture  
 • Use a modular, layered architecture consisting of the following layers:
  – Presentation Layer: GUI using a Python-compatible framework (e.g., PyQt, Tkinter) that communicates with the underlying business logic.
  – Business Logic Layer: Core services for file monitoring, sorting, and logging.
  – Data Access Layer: Responsible for database interactions with SQLite3 and managing configuration file I/O.
 • Utilize a Model-View-Controller (MVC) or similar pattern to separate UI concerns from core logic.

4.2. Concurrency and Asynchronous Processing  
 • Use multithreading or asynchronous I/O to ensure that file monitoring, file moving, and reporting do not block the UI:
  – File monitoring can run in a dedicated background thread or asynchronous loop.
  – Database operations can be batched or queued to minimize blocking.
 • Ensure that proper locking or transactional controls are in place to prevent race conditions, especially on file operations and database accesses.

4.3. File Monitoring and Handling  
 • Evaluate and select the appropriate file system monitoring technique:
  – Leverage platform-specific APIs when available (for example, watchdog library in Python that abstracts these differences).
  – Fall back to a reliable polling mechanism if necessary.
 • Ensure that the moving operation is as atomic as possible:
  – Use temporary file markers or backup copies where required.
  – Cleanly handle failures by reverting changes if a move operation is interrupted.

4.4. Database Schema Design  
 • The SQLite database shall include (at minimum) the following table:
  TABLE: FileMovements  
   – id (primary key, auto-increment)
   – original_path (TEXT)
   – destination_path (TEXT)
   – timestamp (DATETIME)
   – sorting_rule (TEXT)
   – Any additional metadata columns as needed for future enhancements (e.g., file size, file hash)
 • Use parameterized queries and transactions to ensure data integrity and protect against SQL injection, even if the immediate risk is low in a desktop application.

4.5. CSV Export Module  
 • Design a CSV export utility that:
  – Reads from the database and applies user-defined filters.
  – Writes out CSV files following a strict schema that matches the FileMovements table.
  – Includes headers and handles field escape/multi-line values properly.

4.6. Deployment Considerations  
 • Provide an installer that:
  – Creates default configuration files if none exist.
  – Checks for the presence of required Python runtime (3.10+), library dependencies (e.g., watchdog for file monitoring, if used), and SQLite3.
  – Supports multiple operating systems without platform-specific side effects (consider packaging with PyInstaller or using Docker containers).
 • Include a clear README and documentation that outlines installation prerequisites, user guide basics, and troubleshooting steps.

5. PERFORMANCE & TECHNOLOGY STACK SPECIFICATIONS

5.1. Performance Targets  
 • 95% of critical operations (file moves, database writes, file system queries) should complete within 200 milliseconds under a defined “typical load.”  
 • Define testing scenarios for both typical and peak loads, taking into consideration:
  – The number of concurrent file operations.
  – Maximum expected file volume in monitored directories.
  – Benchmarking under simulated user actions (manual triggers via UI).

5.2. Technology Stack  
 • Programming Language: Python (version 3.10 or later).  
 • Database: SQLite3 for managing logs and ensuring local persistence.
  – Evaluate expected concurrent access and plan for performance optimizations (e.g., connection pooling, careful use of transactions).  
 • File Operations: Utilize Python’s standard os and shutil modules for file manipulations, ensuring cross-platform compatibility.  
 • GUI Framework: Select a mature Python GUI framework (such as PyQt or Tkinter) that meets usability and cross-platform demands.  
 • Additional Libraries:
  – Consider using a file system monitoring library (e.g., watchdog) to abstract platform differences.
  – Use standard Python logging libraries to manage both operational and error logs.
