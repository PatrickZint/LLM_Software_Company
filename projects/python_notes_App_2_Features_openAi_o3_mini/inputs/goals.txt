Create a simple note-taking app allowing users to create, view, and delete personal notes.
Features:
Basic UI with a list of notes:
- Add new notes using a simple form
- Edit and delete existing notes
Data Storage:
- Store notes locally in a SQLite database
- Each note has a title, content, and timestamp
The result should be a functional application with a UI, so if necessary, create required config files.
