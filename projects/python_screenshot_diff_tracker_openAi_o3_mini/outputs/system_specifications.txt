Below is a complete system specification document for the screenshot–comparison tool. This document details the functional and non-functional requirements, as well as system design recommendations that address both the application goal and the environment constraints.

─────────────────────────────────────────────  
1. Overview

Objective:  
• Build a desktop application (with potential for web extension) that allows users to load two screenshot images, perform pixel-level comparison with an adjustable tolerance, and export a diff image that highlights differences.  
• Provide a clear and intuitive GUI to handle image selection (via file dialogs and/or drag-and-drop), display, comparison execution, and result export.  
• Enable configuration via both a UI for standard users and configuration file(s) for advanced users.  

Technology Stack:  
• Programming Language: Python (version 3.8 or later recommended)  
• Image Processing:  
 – Pillow (for image file I/O, format conversions, and basic processing; version to be specified, e.g., Pillow 9.x)  
 – OpenCV (for advanced pixel manipulation and computer vision operations; version to be specified, e.g., opencv-python 4.x)  
• Database: SQLite3 (for light weight storage needs such as saving user preferences, logs, or history if required)  
• Dependency Management: Virtual environments (venv or Conda) and a requirements file (requirements.txt or Pipfile)  
• (Optional) Containerization: Docker for consistent deployment across platforms

2. Functional Requirements

A. Image Input  
 1. File Selection:  
  • The application shall allow users to select two image files using a file selection dialog.  
 2. Drag-and-Drop:  
  • (Optional) The UI shall support drag-and-drop functionality for processing images.  
 3. Format Support and Validation:  
  • The application shall support common formats: PNG, JPEG, BMP.  
  • The application shall verify compatibility between images (e.g., check for matching dimensions or prompt user when dimensions differ).  
  • When images differ in dimensions, the application shall either:  
   a. Automatically scale one image to match the dimensions of the other (if enabled via a configuration setting) or  
   b. Notify the user and provide guidance on manual adjustments.

B. Image Comparison  
 1. Pixel-by-Pixel Comparison:  
  • The system shall compare two images on a pixel basis.  
  • A configurable tolerance threshold shall be applied to account for compression artifacts or anti-aliasing differences.  
  • The tolerance may be adjusted via the GUI or a configuration file.  
 2. Diff Generation:  
  • The system shall generate a diff image that highlights pixel-level differences using contrasting colors (e.g., red highlight for mismatches).  
  • The generated image should be easily visualized within the application.

C. Diff Image Export  
 1. Export Functionality:  
  • After processing, a clear “Export” option shall be provided to save the diff image.  
 2. Output Customization:  
  • The user shall be able to choose an output directory.  
  • The file format for export defaults to PNG but should be configurable if needed.  
  • The system should provide a confirmation message on successful export or friendly error feedback when issues occur.

D. Configuration and Customization  
 1. Application Settings:  
  • The application shall provide UI controls for adjusting settings such as the tolerance threshold and default input/output directories.  
 2. Config Files:  
  • A configuration file (e.g., in JSON, YAML, or INI format) shall be provided or generated upon first run.  
  • The config file shall be well-documented and support adjustments for advanced users (for example, toggling scaling behaviors for mismatched dimensions or specifying UI themes).  
 3. Persistence of Settings:  
  • The system shall store user preferences (optionally in SQLite3 or local configuration files) to persist across sessions.

3. Non-Functional Requirements

A. Usability  
 • The GUI shall be intuitive, using common metaphors (drag-and-drop, file browsing) to facilitate ease-of-use.  
 • Clear instructions and contextual help prompts shall be integrated (e.g., tooltips, alerts for errors such as incompatible sizes or unsupported formats).  
 • Provide immediate visual feedback when images are loaded, processed, or when errors occur.

B. Performance  
 • The image comparison engine must process standard screenshot sizes (e.g., 1920×1080) in real or near real time.  
 • The application shall remain responsive during computation with anchoring progress indicators (e.g., progress bars or spinner icons) during processing phases.

C. Portability and Platform Considerations  
 • The primary target platforms shall include Windows, macOS, and Linux.  
 • If a web version is considered in the future, ensure compatible browser support and secure file handling.  
 • OS-specific dependencies (especially for OpenCV) should be clearly documented.

D. Maintainability and Extensibility  
 • The codebase shall be designed modularly to accommodate future enhancements (e.g., additional image formats, video-diff capabilities, or refined image processing algorithms).  
 • Thorough inline documentation, developer guides, and external documentation (including configuration file comments) shall be provided.  
 • Dependencies must be locked and managed via a requirements file to ease future maintenance and environment replication.

4. System Design Recommendations

A. Architecture Overview  
 1. Layered Architecture:  
  • Presentation Layer (GUI):  
   – Build the desktop interface using a Python GUI framework (e.g., PyQt, Tkinter, or Kivy).  
   – Responsible for file selection dialogues, drag-and-drop features, displaying images, and collecting user configurations.  
  • Business Logic Layer (Comparison Engine):  
   – Handle image data processing, including reading and converting image formats between Pillow and OpenCV (e.g., converting PIL.Image to OpenCV’s NumPy arrays).  
   – Implements the pixel-by-pixel comparison with adjustable tolerance and generation of diff images.  
  • Data Access Layer:  
   – Manage configuration files and potential user settings stored in SQLite3 for persistence.  
   – Provide a modular interface for reading/writing settings and logs.

B. Integration Between Pillow and OpenCV  
 • Define clear roles:  
  – Use Pillow for initial image loading, format conversion, and minor processing when needed.  
  – Utilize OpenCV for efficient matrix operations (pixel comparisons) and advanced image processing tasks.  
 • Implement robust conversion functions between Pillow’s Image type and NumPy arrays (used by OpenCV) to minimize overhead.

C. Error Handling and Logging  
 • Implement robust error handling in the UI to deal with invalid image formats, mismatched sizes, or unexpected read/write errors.  
 • Provide descriptive log messages (using Python’s logging module) that capture errors, warnings, and user actions, storing logs in a file (or in SQLite3) to aid in troubleshooting.

D. Dependency and Environment Management  
 • Use a virtual environment (venv or Conda) so that dependencies (Pillow, OpenCV, etc.) are isolated and well-managed.  
 • Lock dependencies in a requirements.txt file; consider using a tool such as pip-tools or Poetry to manage versions.  
 • (Optional) Provide a Dockerfile to facilitate containerized deployment with all dependencies pre-installed.

E. UI/UX Considerations  
 • The main window should include panels for:  
  1. Image Selection: Display file dialogs and support drag-and-drop of images.  
  2. Image Preview: Show loaded images side by side (or overlaid in a split view) and a preview of the diff image once generated.  
  3. Options/Settings Panel: Allow interactive adjustments of tolerance, file paths, and other configuration options.  
  4. Process/Feedback Area: Display progress indicators, error messages, or confirmation dialogs.

F. Data Flow and User Workflow  
 1. Startup: The application initializes, loads configuration settings (from file and/or SQLite3), and creates the main UI window.  
 2. Image Loading: The user selects or drags in images; files are loaded into Pillow, converted as needed, and validated by comparing dimensions.  
 3. Comparison: Upon user initiation, images are converted to a common format (using NumPy arrays if needed) and processed using OpenCV for pixel differences.  
 4. Diff Image: The diff image is generated with visual highlights and displayed in the UI.  
 5. Export: The user specifies an export location and the diff image is saved in the designated format, with feedback on success or error.

5. Documentation and Deliverables

A. User Documentation:  
 • A user guide detailing how to load images, adjust comparison parameters, interpret the diff image, and export results.  
 • Contextual help within the UI (tooltips, error explanations) for common pitfalls like incompatible image sizes.

B. Developer Documentation:  
 • Comments in-code explaining module responsibilities, especially for the integration between Pillow and OpenCV.  
 • A developer guide covering overall architecture, configuration file structure, dependency setup, and how to extend the system.  
 • Sample configuration files with descriptive comments.

C. Testing Documentation:  
 • Unit tests for individual modules (image loading, conversion code, pixel comparison).  
 • End-to-end tests simulating user workflows (loading images, processing, and exporting) including edge cases.

Conclusion

The above system specification details both what the tool must do (functional requirements) and the standards it must meet (non-functional requirements). The modular architecture and clear separation among GUI, business logic, and data access layers will ease maintenance and future extensions. In addition, careful dependency management, error logging, and clear user and developer documentation will create a robust, user-friendly, and scalable image comparison application.

This detailed specification should provide a clear blueprint for development, testing, and eventual deployment.
