Below is a high-level system architecture that meets the specifications. The design is organized into several decoupled layers and modules, allowing for ease of testing, maintenance, and future extensibility.

─────────────────────────────────────────────

1. Architectural Overview

The application adopts a modular, layered architecture separating responsibilities into distinct components. The primary layers are:

• User Interface (Presentation Layer)  
• Business Logic (Application Layer)  
• Infrastructure Services (File System, Monitoring, and Logging)  
• Persistence (Configuration and Database)

The design leverages common design patterns such as Observer (for directory monitoring) and Command (for executing file movements) to improve modularity.

2. Component Design

A. User Interface (GUI Module)

 • Functionality:  
  – Provides an intuitive, cross-platform graphical interface (using PyQt/PySide, Tkinter, or even Electron with Python integration)  
  – Allows users to configure monitored directories, define or modify organization rules, trigger dry-run operations, view real-time notifications, filter logs, and export CSV reports

 • Key Responsibilities:  
  – Interacts asynchronously with background services to ensure responsiveness  
  – Presents configuration options and status updates (progress, errors, success notifications)  
  – Provides an administration panel for configuration updates that immediately affect operational parameters or clearly indicate when a restart is required  

 • Technology:  
  – PyQt/PySide for native look-and-feel on Windows, macOS, and Linux (or alternative frameworks like Tkinter/Electron)

B. Configuration Manager

 • Functionality:  
  – Loads and validates configuration files (supporting JSON, YAML, or XML formats)  
  – Synchronizes configuration data between file-based storage and runtime in-memory settings  
  – Monitors changes (from either GUI updates or direct file edits) and applies them either immediately or after restart as defined by the system’s policies

 • Key Responsibilities:  
  – Provide APIs to read, update, and persist configurations  
  – Validate updated settings to prevent misconfiguration  
  – Generate default configurations if missing

 • Technology:  
  – Standard Python libraries (json, xml.etree, PyYAML) for parsing  
  – Integration with GUI settings module

C. Directory Monitoring & File Change Detector

 • Functionality:  
  – Monitors user-specified directories in real time  
  – Detects file events such as creation or updates using either OS notification APIs (via watchdog library) or a configurable polling mechanism (e.g., every 5 seconds)

 • Key Responsibilities:  
  – Validate directory accessibility  
  – Emit events (via an Observer pattern) to trigger file organization rules

 • Technology:  
  – watchdog Python library for real-time notifications  
  – Threading or asyncio for non-blocking monitoring

D. Rule Engine

 • Functionality:  
  – Applies a series of pluggable and modular file organization rules (by file type, creation date, etc.)  
  – Supports customizable parameters such as folder naming conventions and conflict resolution strategies  
  – Allows dynamic reordering, enable/disable, and customization of rules via the GUI

 • Key Responsibilities:  
  – Define rule classes implementing a common interface (Command Pattern) to process file events  
  – Manage rule priority and order as determined by user configuration  
  – Enable “dry-run” operations where movements are simulated without impacting the file system

 • Technology:  
  – Pure Python object-oriented design  
  – Clear API boundaries for rule plug-ins to simplify future enhancements

E. File Movement and Exception Handling Module

 • Functionality:  
  – Executes the actual moving/renaming of files based on rule outcomes  
  – Handles issues like file locks, permission errors, or I/O exceptions  
  – Supports conflict resolution policies (e.g., renaming files with a unique identifier or skipping)

 • Key Responsibilities:  
  – Act as a transaction-like service that can perform rollbacks or retries if a file operation fails  
  – Report operation status back to the GUI and logging modules  
  – Integrate with logging to record every attempted file operation

 • Technology:  
  – Python’s os and shutil modules for file operations  
  – Robust error handling using Python exception handling and logging patterns

F. Logging and Reporting Module

 • Functionality:  
  – Records all file operations along with metadata (timestamp, source/destination, rule applied)  
  – Supports querying and filtering logs, and exporting reports in CSV format

 • Key Responsibilities:  
  – Persist logs in an embedded SQLite3 database with a schema designed for high-frequency, lightweight writes  
  – Provide an abstraction layer for querying historical data and linking log events with rule operations  
  – Integrate with the GUI to enable real-time status updates and report generation

 • Technology:  
  – Python’s built-in sqlite3 module  
  – Standard logging module for structured error reporting

G. Service Mode and Deployment Manager

 • Functionality:  
  – Supports running the file organizer in daemon/background mode even when the GUI is closed  
  – Manages resource usage, error logging in a headless environment, and facilitates containerized deployment via Docker if needed

 • Key Responsibilities:  
  – Provide a startup routine that initializes all modules in the correct sequence  
  – Monitor service health and restart components in case of transient failures based on configured policies  
  – Document OS-specific installation details

 • Technology:  
  – Python standard libraries for process/thread management  
  – Docker for containerization, if container deployment is desired

3. Technology Stack Summary

• Language and Runtime:  
 – Python 3.8+ (ensuring compatibility with introduced standard modules and libraries)

• File System & Monitoring:  
 – os and shutil (for file operations)  
 – watchdog (for real-time directory monitoring); fallback to custom polling logic as necessary

• GUI Framework:  
 – PyQt5 or PySide2 are preferred for a cross-platform, native feel  
 – Alternatively, Tkinter for simpler UIs or Electron for a web-based GUI with Python back-end integration

• Database:  
 – SQLite3 (embedded logging and persistence of file operation records)  
 – Configurable schema designed to handle high log write volume

• Configuration Parsing:  
 – json (natively in Python)  
 – PyYAML for YAML if chosen  
 – ElementTree or similar libraries for XML configurations

• Concurrency and Asynchronous Operations:  
 – Python threading or asyncio to offload monitoring and file movement processing away from the main GUI thread

• Packaging and Deployment:  
 – PyInstaller or similar tools for creating stand-alone executables  
 – Docker for container-based deployment (if applicable)

4. Interaction Flow (High-Level Sequence)

1. Initialization:  
 a. On startup, the Configuration Manager loads the configuration file (or generates defaults if missing).  
 b. The Logging Module initializes the SQLite database.  
 c. The GUI module is launched, displaying current settings and the status dashboard.

2. Monitoring Phase:  
 a. The Directory Monitoring module begins watching configured directories via watchdog (or polling).  
 b. Detected file events are published to the system using an Observer pattern.

3. Rule Execution:  
 a. The Rule Engine receives file events and sequentially applies active rules based on user-defined order.  
 b. The File Movement module executes the rule, either in normal or dry-run mode.

4. Logging and Reporting:  
 a. Every file operation (successful or failed) is logged in SQLite.  
 b. The Reporting module enables users to filter and export logs as CSV via the GUI.

5. User Interaction:  
 a. The GUI displays notifications, error messages, and progress indicators.  
 b. Users may adjust configurations in real time, with changes dispatched to the Configuration Manager.

5. Summary

This high-level architecture clearly separates the concerns across interface, business logic, file system services, and persistence. By using Python with its extensive standard libraries alongside select third-party modules (e.g., watchdog, PyQt/PySide), the system aligns well with the requirements for cross-platform compatibility, performance, and extensibility. The modular design also ensures that new functionality (such as additional file rules) or future migration (e.g., to a more robust database) can be integrated with minimal rework.

This blueprint lays a strong foundation for development, testing (unit/integration tests for each component), and eventual deployment in various environments while addressing both the functional and non-functional requirements specified.
