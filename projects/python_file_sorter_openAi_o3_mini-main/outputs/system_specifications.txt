Below is a detailed system specification document that consolidates the refined goals, functional and non-functional requirements, and environment observations into a blueprint for designing, implementing, and validating the automated file organizer application.

──────────────────────────────
1. Overview

Objective:
• Develop an automated file organizer application featuring a user-friendly graphical interface that continuously monitors user-specified directories, applies customizable file organization rules (by file type or creation date), moves files accordingly, and logs all operations into a persistent database.  
• The application must support report generation in CSV format and allow configuration through both the UI and configuration files (JSON, YAML, or XML).  
• It is to be built using Python (minimum version 3.8), with standard modules (os, shutil) and SQLite3 for embedded logging. Optionally, a cross-platform framework (e.g., Qt or Electron) can be used for the GUI.

2. Functional Requirements

A. Directory Monitoring & File Detection  
 1. Directory Configuration  
  • The user can specify one or more directories via the GUI and/or configuration file.  
  • Each monitored directory should be validated to confirm accessibility.  
 2. Continuous Monitoring  
  • The application continuously tracks the specified directories for new or modified files.  
  • Real-time detection is preferred; however, a configurable polling interval (e.g., every 5 seconds) must be available.  
 3. File Change Detection  
  • The system detects file events (creation, updates) reliably, using OS notifications where available or a polling mechanism if necessary.

B. File Organization Rules  
 1. Supported Organization Types  
  a. By File Type  
   • Files are routed into target directories based on file extension and/or MIME type.  
  b. By Creation Date  
   • Files are automatically moved into date-stamped subdirectories (e.g., Year/Month/Day or Year-Month formats).  
 2. Rule Engine  
  • Implement a modular, pluggable rule engine that applies one or more rules in a user-defined order.  
  • Each rule must include parameters for file type/dates, target folder naming conventions, and conflict resolution.  
 3. Customization Interface  
  • The GUI must provide an interface for users to add, update, enable/disable, and reorder rules.  
  • Users can specify custom folder naming patterns and set policies (e.g., append a unique identifier if a file with the same name exists).

C. File Movement  
 1. Rule Application and Movement  
  • Upon file detection, the system determines the applicable organizational rule(s) and relocates the file accordingly.  
 2. Exception and Conflict Handling  
  • The system must gracefully handle exceptions, including file permission errors, file locks, or I/O issues.  
  • The UI must notify the user of failures and provide an option to retry the operation.  
 3. Dry Run Mode  
  • Allow a “preview” or dry run mode so users can simulate file movements, review changes, and then confirm before actual file movements occur.

D. Logging and Reporting  
 1. Operation Logging  
  • Every file movement is recorded in the database with a timestamp, original path, destination path, and the rule applied.  
 2. Database and Persistency  
  • The system uses an embedded SQLite database to store logs locally, with a defined schema for querying historical operations.  
 3. Export and Reporting  
  • The UI must provide functionality to filter logs (by date range, file type, etc.) and export reports in CSV format.

E. Configuration & Setup  
 1. Configuration Management  
  • The application must create or use an existing configuration file (JSON, YAML, or XML) defining monitored directories, file organization rules, database connection settings, and reporting options.  
 2. Dual Configuration Interfaces  
  • Users can update configurations via the GUI or directly by editing the configuration file; all changes must be validated.  
 3. Immediate or Deferred Application  
  • Some configuration changes (e.g., folder paths, rules) should take immediate effect; others may require a restart with a clear notice provided in the UI.

──────────────────────────────
3. Non-Functional Requirements

A. Usability  
 1. Intuitive GUI  
  • The user interface must be simple and intuitive for non-expert users, with clearly labeled menus, tooltips, and contextual help.  
 2. Immediate Feedback  
  • Users must receive real-time operation feedback through notifications, visual status indicators (e.g., “processing”, “success”, “error”), and progress indicators if processing large batches of files.

B. Performance  
 1. Low Latency and Responsiveness  
  • The directory monitoring component is designed with measurable performance targets—for example, a response time under 500 milliseconds for detected file events under normal load.  
 2. System Resource Utilization  
  • The application should be resource-efficient, aiming for CPU utilization below 70% and memory usage under 500 MB during standard operations.  
 3. Scalability  
  • The system must correctly scale to handle a high volume of file events (e.g., up to 100 events per minute) without significant degradation.

C. Reliability & Error Handling  
 1. Data Integrity  
  • Ensure that file operations (e.g., moves) are executed reliably with no data corruption or loss, using rollback or retry strategies in case of partial failures.  
 2. Robust Error Logging  
  • All exceptions, permission errors, or conflicts must be logged, and corresponding error codes/messages should be generated.  
 3. Continuous Operation  
  • The system should gracefully recover from errors without requiring a full shutdown, and it should support running in a background (daemon) mode.

D. Extensibility  
 1. Future-Proofing the Rule Engine  
  • The design must allow additional file organization rules (e.g., sorting by file size, modification date, metadata) to be integrated without major refactoring.  
 2. Configurability  
  • Using human-readable configuration formats (JSON, YAML, or XML) ensures that future enhancements and integrations can be implemented with minimal disruptions.

E. Security  
 1. Data Exposure Prevention  
  • Ensure that file operations and the logging process do not expose sensitive data. Validate all file paths to prevent directory traversal and other vulnerabilities.  
 2. Access Controls  
  • If administrative operations are present (e.g., modifying configuration files), enforce appropriate user access controls.  
 3. Validation  
  • All user inputs (whether via the GUI or config file) should be validated to prevent injection attacks or erroneous configurations.

4. System Design Recommendations

A. Architectural Overview  
 • Consider a modular, layered architecture that decouples the GUI, business logic (including the rule engine), monitoring services, and logging/reporting modules.  
 • Use design patterns such as Observer/Listener for directory monitoring and Command for rule execution to improve maintainability and extensibility.

B. Technology Stack  
 1. Python (minimum version 3.8)  
  • Leverage standard libraries (os, shutil) for file operations.  
  • Use additional modules (e.g., watchdog for real-time file monitoring, threading or asyncio for concurrency, and logging for structured error messages).
 2. SQLite3  
  • Use SQLite for storing logs; design an efficient schema to accommodate frequent writes and queries.  
  • Document concurrency expectations; if necessary, plan for future migration to a more robust DB system under the scale-up scenario.
 3. GUI Framework  
  • For cross-platform compatibility, consider frameworks like PyQt/PySide, Tkinter, or Electron (with Python back-end integration).  
  • The GUI should interact asynchronously with background services to avoid UI freezes during file operations.

C. Service Modes and Deployment  
 1. Background/Daemon Mode  
  • Allow the file organizer to run as a background service or daemon even when the GUI is minimized or closed.  
  • Ensure that the mode properly handles system resource management and logs errors, even in headless operation.
 2. Deployment Environments  
  • Clearly define the target operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux) and account for OS-specific file system behaviors.  
  • Provide a detailed installation and deployment guide, including instructions for containerized deployments (e.g., using Docker) if needed.

D. Error Handling and Rollback Strategies  
 • Implement a robust error handling strategy in file movement modules. Consider using transaction-like processing for batch operations that can be rolled back in case of failures.  
 • Define strategies for conflict resolution (manual intervention via UI, automatic renaming, or skipping files) that are configurable by the user.

E. Testing and Benchmarking  
 • Establish automated unit and integration tests to validate each module:
  - Unit tests for directory monitoring, rule engine logic, file movements, and configuration parsing.
  - Integration tests for the end-to-end process (including dry run mode, logging, error recovery, and CSV export).  
 • Incorporate performance testing (e.g., simulating high file event loads) to ensure the latency and throughput targets are met.  
 • Document performance assumptions regarding CPU, memory, and storage speeds for benchmarking purposes.

F. Documentation  
 • Prepare comprehensive documentation covering:
  - Installation guides  
  - User manuals for rule configuration, usage of dry run mode, and report generation  
  - Administrator guides detailing configuration file syntax, deployment configurations, and troubleshooting procedures.

5. Acceptance Criteria

The system will be considered complete and acceptable when the following criteria are met:
• A file added to any monitored directory is automatically processed, with its destination determined by the active rule(s), and subsequently moved.  
• All file movements are reliably logged with the correct timestamp, source, destination, and associated rule details in the SQLite database.  
• The GUI displays real-time notifications of operations, errors, and supports log filtering and CSV export of reports accurately.  
• The configuration file is automatically generated if missing, validated on load, and any updates (via GUI or direct edit) take immediate effect or provide proper restart instructions.  
• The application demonstrates robust error handling by gracefully notifying users about issues such as file lock, permissions, or other I/O errors without crashing.  
• Performance tests confirm that the system responds to file events within 500 milliseconds and handles up to 100 file events per minute, while consuming acceptable CPU and memory resources.

Summary

This detailed system specification defines the functional and non-functional requirements as well as the system design recommendations for the file organizer application. Adhering to these specifications will ensure that the application not only meets user expectations regarding file organization and reporting but also remains robust, secure, extensible, and well-documented. Each module—from directory monitoring to the rule engine and logging—should be developed with modularity and clear interfaces in mind, thereby facilitating testing, future enhancements, and cross-platform compatibility.
