Below is a high-level system architecture that maps directly to the specified requirements, emphasizes modularity and testability, and leverages the recommended technology stack. The design is organized into logical components that follow an MVC (Model-View-Controller) or similar separation to isolate the GUI presentation from business logic and data persistence. The following sections describe the component design and the associated technology stack selection.

────────────────────────────
1. OVERALL ARCHITECTURE

• Design Pattern:  
 – Use an MVC/MVP pattern where the:
  – Model manages data representations (notes, categories, tags) and handles the SQLite database interactions.
  – View is implemented using Tkinter to provide a multi-panel GUI (e.g., main view, sidebar/filtering panel, detailed note/editor view).
  – Controller (or Presenter) interprets user actions from the GUI, validates inputs, and coordinates with the Model to perform CRUD operations, export/import, and configuration management.

────────────────────────────
2. COMPONENT DESIGN

A. User Interface (View)  
 • Technology: Tkinter (with possible extended widgets for rich text editing)  
 • Responsibilities:
  – Render the main notes list view, sidebar (categories, tags, search/filter), and detailed note viewing/editing panel.
  – Allow toggling between raw Markdown input and a WYSIWYG-style rich text editor.
  – Provide dialogs and confirmation prompts for operations like delete, import/export, and configuration changes.
 • Implementation Details:
  – Organize the UI using frames—one for the header/navigation, one for the list view, one for the detailed view, and one for the sidebar.
  – Use grid or pack managers to handle window resizing and layout adjustments.
  – Include tooltips and help dialogs inline with accessibility best practices.

B. Application Logic (Controller/Presenter)  
 • Technology: Pure Python modules implementing business logic  
 • Responsibilities:
  – Handle user actions (e.g., “create,” “edit,” “delete” note).
  – Validate input and manage UI-model interactions.
  – Coordinate rich text formatting tasks (switching between Markdown and WYSIWYG, triggering syntax highlighting for code snippets).
  – Manage data import/export operations and configuration reading/writing.
 • Implementation Details:
  – Organize code into modules (e.g., note_controller.py, formatting_controller.py, config_manager.py) for modularity.
  – Implement business rules (e.g., timestamp updates, field validations) in controller modules.

C. Data Model and Persistence (Model)  
 • Technology: Python’s built-in sqlite3 module to interface with SQLite  
 • Responsibilities:
  – Define object representations for notes, categories, tags, and manage relationships (using many-to-many mapping tables for categories and tags).
  – Encapsulate all CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete) and ensure proper transaction handling.
  – Implement SQL indexing on critical fields (title, created_at, updated_at) for performance.
 • Implementation Details:
  – Design a normalized database schema with tables:
   – Notes (id, title, content, created_at, updated_at, formatting metadata)
   – Categories and Tags (each with an id and name)
   – Association tables (e.g., NoteCategories, NoteTags) for many-to-many relationships.
  – Encapsulate database calls within dedicated modules (e.g., note_dao.py) to isolate query logic.

D. JSON Import/Export and Configuration Management  
 • Technology: Python’s JSON standard library  
 • Responsibilities:
  – Serialize note objects (with their metadata) into a JSON file for export.
  – Deserialize JSON files to import notes, performing validations and merging/updating existing records.
  – Manage application configuration settings (e.g., theme preference, file paths) using JSON (or INI/YAML if needed) stored locally.
 • Implementation Details:
  – Create a dedicated module (e.g., data_io.py or config_manager.py) that handles file I/O.
  – Validate JSON data structure before performing any database operations.
  – Provide clear user feedback via the UI on successful or failed import/export operations.

E. Packaging and Distribution  
 • Technology: Packaging tools such as PyInstaller or cx_Freeze  
 • Responsibilities:
  – Bundle the application, including all Python dependencies and the Tcl/Tk runtime, into standalone executables.
  – Ensure cross-platform compatibility for Windows, macOS, and Linux.
 • Implementation Details:
  – Include a requirements.txt file for dependency management.
  – Automate virtual environment setup and apply linting/test hooks (using tools like flake8, pylint, or Black, and pytest/unittest for testing).

────────────────────────────
3. TECHNOLOGY STACK & DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT

• Primary Language: Python 3.9+  
• GUI Toolkit: Tkinter (with consideration for cross-platform differences and third-party extensions if needed for rich text/syntax highlighting)  
• Database: SQLite (accessed through Python’s sqlite3 module)  
• Packaging Tools: PyInstaller or cx_Freeze  
• Dependency Management: Virtual environments (venv) with requirements.txt for external libraries  
• Testing Framework: unittest or pytest for unit testing of model, controller, and configuration modules  
• Code Quality: Use flake8, pylint, and Black for code style and linting  
• Configuration Files: JSON (config.json) stored in a designated directory for ease in modifying parameters like the database file path, theme, export paths, and editor settings

5. DEVELOPMENT AND MAINTENANCE CONSIDERATIONS

• Modularity:  
 – Each component (UI, Controller, Model, JSON/Config) is isolated in separate modules to promote testing and future extensibility (e.g., adding a cloud sync feature).
  
• Testing:  
 – Unit tests are written using unittest/pytest covering all layers.  
 – Integration tests ensure that the UI properly triggers actions in the controller and that the database updates as expected.

• Code Quality & Continuous Integration:
 – Use pre-commit hooks for linting and formatting.
 – Automate testing within a CI pipeline to ensure changes do not break core functionality.

• Documentation:
 – Clearly document code, configuration file parameters, and design decisions to aid both end users and future developers.

SUMMARY

The proposed high-level system architecture leverages an MVC/MVP pattern to separate concerns: the Tkinter-based GUI (View), Python-based controllers (Controller/Presenter), a SQLite-backed Model for persistence, and dedicated modules for JSON import/export and configuration management. This layered approach, supported by Python’s standard libraries and third-party tools for testing and packaging, ensures the application is modular, extensible, and maintainable while providing a rich set of features for managing and formatting notes efficiently.
