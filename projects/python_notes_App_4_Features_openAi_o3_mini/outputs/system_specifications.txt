2. FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

A. Note Management  
 1. Create Note  
  • Provide a form-based UI for creating a new note.  
  • Mandatory fields: Title and Content.  
  • Automatically generate a creation timestamp (date and time).  
  • Allow optional assignment of categories and tags.  

 2. View Note  
  • Display a list view showing all notes with key details: title, content preview, and timestamp.  
  • Support a detailed view for individual notes that shows full content, applied formatting, and metadata.  

 3. Edit Note  
  • Enable modification of note elements: title, content, categories, tags, and formatting.
  • Automatically update the “last modified” timestamp on saving changes.  

 4. Delete Note  
  • Allow deletion of notes from either the detailed view or list view.
  • Include a confirmation prompt to safeguard against accidental deletions.

B. Rich Text and Formatting  
 1. Text Formatting  
  • Support Markdown syntax for styling (headings, lists, links, etc.).  
  • Include WYSIWYG editing features for users who prefer not to use Markdown (bold, italic, underline, color highlighting).  

 2. Code Snippets  
  • Allow insertion of code snippets with syntax highlighting.  
  • Provide an option for specifying the programming language to correctly apply syntax highlighting.

 3. Customization  
  • Provide controls (color palettes, font settings) to customize display and highlight options.

C. Metadata, Categories, and Tags  
 1. Categories & Tags  
  • Enable assigning one or more categories and multiple tags per note.  
  • Provide UI components (dropdowns, auto-complete text fields) for easy selection and input.  

 2. Search and Filtering  
  • Implement a keyword-based search across titles, content, tags, and categories.  
  • Offer filtering options by category, tag, or creation/modified date ranges.  

 3. Timestamps  
  • Store both the creation and last modified timestamps with each note record.

D. Data Storage and Portability  
 1. Local Persistence  
  • Use SQLite as the local database engine.  
  • Define a clear database schema incorporating title, content, timestamps, categories, tags, and formatting metadata.  

 2. Export/Import  
  • Allow users to export selected or all notes to a JSON file.  
  • Provide JSON-based import functionality, enabling merging or updating of existing notes.  

 3. Backup/Recovery  
  • Optionally implement local backup features or transactional logs to facilitate recovery from data corruption.

E. User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX)  
 1. UI Layout  
  • Main window listing notes and their summaries.  
  • Sidebar or filtering panel for category, tag, and search filtering.  
  • Dedicated note editing view that supports toggling between raw Markdown and WYSIWYG-rich text editing.  

 2. Navigation  
  • Clear and intuitive navigation between list and detail views.  
  • Prominently placed buttons and dialogs for core operations (create, edit, delete, import, export).  

 3. Configurations  
  • Support user and developer configurations (via JSON, YAML, or INI files) for UI themes, default file paths, database locations, and editor settings.  
  • Example config settings include:  
   – DatabaseFilePath (e.g., data/notes.db)  
   – Theme (light/dark)  
   – DefaultExportPath  
   – Editor settings (e.g., font size, font family, syntax highlighting enabled)

3. NON‐FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

A. Performance & Scalability  
 – Maintain responsive UI and fast operations even with hundreds to low thousands of notes.  
 – Optimize search and filtering, ensuring near-instantaneous return of results using proper indexing techniques in SQLite.

B. Usability & Accessibility  
 – Design an intuitive interface with consistent navigation and clear functional labels.  
 – Provide in-app tooltips, documentation, or help guides for formatting and note operations.  
 – Include accessibility features such as keyboard shortcuts, adjustable font sizes, and compatibility with screen readers.

C. Security & Data Integrity  
 – Sanitize all user inputs to mitigate injection or malformed data issues in both the SQLite database and any JSON parsing.  
 – Implement robust data validation and error handling for CRUD operations and file import/export.  
 – Establish measures (logging, backups) to preserve data integrity even if application internals or user operations fail.

D. Portability  
 – Ensure the application runs seamlessly on Windows, macOS, and Linux with consistent look-and-feel.  
 – Test and document any platform-specific adjustments required by Tkinter, especially in layout and widget styling.

E. Maintainability & Extensibility  
 – Employ a modular code architecture to promote feature extension (e.g., future cloud sync, enhanced UI components).  
 – Include comprehensive unit tests (with pytest or unittest) covering core functionalities (CRUD operations, formatting, import/export).  
 – Use linting and formatting tools (flake8, pylint, Black) to maintain code quality.  
 – Document design decisions and configuration management to support future developer onboarding and system evolution.

──────────────────────────────
4. SYSTEM DESIGN & IMPLEMENTATION RECOMMENDATIONS

A. Architecture Overview  
 – Adopt a Model-View-Controller (MVC) or Model-View-Presenter (MVP) architectural pattern to separate business logic, UI presentation, and data access.  
 – Model: Encapsulate note data (including title, content, metadata, timestamps) and interface with the SQLite database.  
 – View: Build the GUI using Tkinter, ensuring widgets are organized into distinct panels (main list, sidebar, detail view).  
 – Controller/Presenter: Manage user actions, validate inputs, and bridge communication between the view and model.

B. Database Design  
 – Define a normalized schema with at least the following tables:  
  • Notes: store ID, title, content, created_at, updated_at  
  • Categories: store category ID and name  
  • Tags: store tag ID and name  
  • Mapping tables (e.g., NoteCategories, NoteTags) to support many-to-many relationships.  
 – Use SQL indexing on frequently searched columns (e.g., title, timestamps) to optimize performance.

C. UI/UX Considerations  
 – Leverage Tkinter frames to separate the main list, sidebar, and editing views.  
 – Implement responsive designs by using grid and pack managers properly to account for window resizing.  
 – Encourage consistency by standardizing widget styles and employing theming support (light/dark themes based on a configuration file).  
 – Consider third-party Tkinter extensions if necessary for enhanced components (e.g., text editing with code syntax highlighting).

D. Data Import/Export & Configuration  
 – Use Python’s JSON module to serialize/deserialize note data ensuring compatibility with the defined schema.  
 – Validate JSON structure on import to detect conflicts or data inconsistencies before merging with existing notes.  
 – Implement clear user feedback via dialogs or status notifications upon successful or failed import/export operations.  
 – Store configuration files (e.g., config.json) within a designated directory and load settings at runtime to manage system parameters (database path, theme, export paths, editor configurations).

E. Dependency Management & Testing  
 – Use virtual environments (e.g., venv) to encapsulate dependencies and list them in a requirements.txt file.  
 – Establish a testing framework using unittest or pytest for core functionalities.  
 – Automate linting and testing as part of the development cycle (using tools like pre-commit hooks) to ensure code quality and stability.

F. Packaging and Distribution  
 – Utilize packaging tools like PyInstaller or cx_Freeze to produce standalone executables for end-users not familiar with Python installations.  
 – Ensure that the packaged application includes all necessary runtime dependencies (notably the Tcl/Tk libraries required by Tkinter) for each supported platform.
