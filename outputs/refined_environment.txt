Below is an analysis and refinement of the provided requirements:

1. Vague Performance Metrics:  
 • Original: “The system must provide a reasonable performance.”  
 • Issue: “Reasonable” is subjective. It isn’t clear what constitutes acceptable performance (e.g., response times, throughput, scalability under load).  

2. Refining Performance Requirements:  
 • Define measurable targets: Specify key performance indicators (KPIs) such as response time, number of concurrent users, transactions per second, memory usage, or throughput.  
 • Examples might include:  
  – “Under peak load, the system shall process at least 500 requests per minute, with 95% of requests receiving a response within 300 ms.”  
  – “The system must scale to support 100 concurrent users with a maximum response time of 500 ms for any operation.”  
 • Including such metrics promises developers and testers clear criteria for success.

3. Considering Python’s Impact:  
 • Since the technology stack is Python, it is important to determine which Python frameworks and libraries will be used, as they affect performance (e.g., synchronous versus asynchronous frameworks).  
 • Example: “Using Python with Flask/FastAPI allows concurrent connections to be managed efficiently. The system must employ asynchronous processing where applicable to meet performance KPIs.”  
 • It could also be beneficial to note if performance-critical components will use optimized libraries (e.g., C extensions) or if performance optimization techniques like caching and load balancing are planned.

4. Environmental & Deployment Considerations:  
 • Clarify if the system will be deployed in environments that impose additional constraints (e.g., cloud, on-premises, containerized deployments).  
 • You might also specify that performance tests should mimic production-like environments to ensure the system meets the defined metrics.

5. Additional Non-functional Requirements:  
 • Consider including guidelines for monitoring and logging system performance in production to continuously validate that the system’s performance remains within acceptable limits.  
 • For instance: “The system must include instrumentation to log request latency and error rates so that deviations from the performance benchmarks can be quickly detected."

Summary of Refined Requirement Example:  
 "The system, implemented in Python using [selected framework], must handle at least 500 requests per minute (or 100 concurrent users) with a 95th percentile response time under 300 ms. Performance tests must simulate production load, and the system should incorporate asynchronous processing and caching techniques to maintain these benchmarks." 

By making these requirements precise, you reduce ambiguity, facilitate effective testing, and ensure the development team understands the performance objectives from the start.
