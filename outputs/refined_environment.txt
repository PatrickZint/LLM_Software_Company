In developing this application with these given criteria, we need the technology choices that ensure both security as well good performant behavior of our program in relation to environmental constraints like resource utilization (CPU time & memory). 

The following are some suggestions for a tech-stack based on your requirements and modern practices. We can modify it depending upon specific needs or additional features:  
1. **Backend**: Node.js with Express framework - It's highly scalable, open source platform built around JavaScript which provides good performance due to its single threaded event loop architecture that doesn’t block the execution of other requests when dealing I/O intensive tasks like reading from disk (database) or network operations etc., 
2. **Database**: MongoDB with Mongoose ODM - It's a NoSQL database, suitable for applications requiring high availability and easy scalability because it has good performance in handling large amounts data & supports asynchronous programming which fits well to NodeJs environment..   
3.**Authentication/Authorization (Security)**: PassportJS or JSON Web Tokens(JWT)- They are standard ways of securely identifying users across different services, ensuring secure communication between server and client-side apps by encrypting the user’s data with a secret key that only your app knows about which makes it easier to scale.
4.**Testing Tools**: Mocha & Chai (Javascript testing) – They are asynchronous friendly thus supporting non blocking operations making them ideal for NodeJs based applications and ensure reliable, repeatable tests by reducing dependencies between test cases using the AAA pattern of arrange-act-assert or given-when-then respectively which is easier to maintain.
5.**CI/CD Pipeline**: Jenkins – It's a automation server that can be used to automate various stages in software development including building, testing and deployment processes providing continuous integration & delivery facilitating faster releases with higher quality because it allows for early identification of bugs or issues before they reach production environment..  
6. **Containerization Tool** - Docker: This provides an extra level of isolation which prevents the system from being affected by other applications running on same machine, making sure that application is consistently deployed in different environments regardless if developer’s local dev station and Production server are using similar or not alike OS configurations... 
7. Lastly but very importantly for environmental consideration - **Cloud Platform**: AWS (Amazon Web Services) provides a vast range of products like EC2(Elastic Compute Cloud), S3 buckets etc., that can be used to deploy our application with pay-as-you-go model and also there are many services which reduces the energy consumption in data centers e.g, Amazon’s efficient hardware infrastructure or switching on/off instances based upon demand (Auto Scaling).
   
Remember always - When developing software solutions for any environment consideration it's important to consider not just technical aspects but all factors that might influence system performance and stability including network latency & speed etc., so a comprehensive approach is key. Always measure, track and optimize your application’s metrics regularly which can help you understand its behavior under different load scenarios.. 
   
Please note this answer was provided keeping in mind modern practices like microservices architecture if the project scale significantly large or serverless technology stack for zero management overhead while running applications on AWS etc., depending upon specific needs and constraints of your application. Always consider factors such as team expertise, existing tech-stack compatibility & cost when choosing technologies..
