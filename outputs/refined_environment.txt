To develop the mentioned requirements of security-driven application, we would need technologies that offer robust protection while providing excellent runtime performances with good developer productivity tools available in their ecosystems for easy debugging or troubleshooting if necessary. 
Here are some tech stacks you might consider based on these constraints and general preferences among top developers/companies:

1) **Java + Spring Boot**: Java is one of the most secure languages due to its nature, which can be augmented with libraries like Spring Security (for security), Hibernate or JPA for database operations. Performance wise it's quite good as well because JVM provides a lot optimizations and also supports multi-threading very efficiently 
    - **Pros:** Great community support & maturity in enterprise applications; high performance due to the use of Java Virtual Machine(JVM) ; excellent security features offered by Spring Security, Hibernate.  
    - **Cons**: Verbose for certain operations compared with other languages like Python or Go but this can be mitigated using tools and practices (like JPA). 
    
2)**Python + Django/Flask Framework:** As a language that emphasizes readability & simplicity of code which is great in team collaboration. It has libraries such as `Django Security` for security measures; performance wise Python isn't bad, it can be slower compared to languages like C++ and Java but this trade-off depends on the use case (for some cases web scraping or data analysis).
    - **Pros:** Great community support & readability of code ; has excellent libraries/frameworks such as Django security for securing applications. 
    -**Cons**: Slower compared to compiled languages like C++ and Java, but this is often negligible in many use-cases; less mature stack than others (Java or PHP) which might lead fewer jobs opportunities later on if you're planning a long term career with software development .  
    
3) **JavaScript/TypeScript + Node.js:** This combination of technologies are known for their speed and efficient memory management due to the event-driven nature, also they can be used in both front end (with React or Angular frameworks), back end(Express framework). It has libraries like `express` which provide security measures too; 
    - **Pros**: Great community support & scalability since it's JavaScript based. Express provides robust features for securing the app.; good runtime performance because of event-driven architecture and non-blocking I/O model in NodeJs   .    
      Cons: Slower compared to compiled languages but this is often negligible; might face issues when deploying on shared servers due multi threading nature (but mitigated by cluster module). 
    - **Cons**: The learning curve for JavaScript can be steep, especially if you're coming from a Java or C# background.  
    
Remember that the "best" technology stack depends heavily upon your teamâ€™s skills and preferences as well as what kind of application is being developed (web apps? desktop applications?). Consider these factors to determine which tech-stack suits best in this situation!  It's always a good idea before starting development process, do some research on the technologies you are going to use.
