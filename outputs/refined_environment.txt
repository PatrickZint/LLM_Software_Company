As an AI model trained on computer science concepts, I can suggest some potential technology stacks based upon the requirements you mentioned but please note that it's important to consider specific project needs such as team expertise or business objectives before choosing any technologies and frameworks.: 

1) Frontend Development - Depending whether we are talking about a traditional desktop application (like Windows/Mac app), Web Application, Mobile App(Android & iOS): For web applications AngularJS could be an excellent choice due to its two-way data binding. VueJs or React JS can also suit well if you're looking for performance and flexibility respectively but they might require more learning curve compared with the former ones depending on your team expertise level.
  If we are talking about a mobile app, Flutter by Google would be an excellent choice due to its cross-platform nature that allows developers to build native interfaces in record time while having only one codebase for both Android and iOS platforms which is important from performance perspective as well considering current high costs of maintaining two separate projects.
  For Windows/Mac applications we can use Electron or .Net Framework with WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation). These options offer a higher level abstraction than writing raw UI components, allowing faster development times but may sacrifice some control over the native interface and functionality if compared to direct usage from Apple's SDK for MacOS apps.
  
2) Backend Development - Depending on whether you need real-time features or not: If your application doesn’t require any live updates then NodeJS with Express could be a good choice due its nonblocking I/O model which makes it lightweight and efficient in data handling, especially when dealing large numbers of concurrent connections.
  But if the requirement includes anything related to WebSocket for real-time communication (like chat applications or multiplayer games), you might want consider GoLang with Gin framework because they offer high performance thanks their concurrency mechanism ("Goroutines") which can handle a lot more requests compared traditional multi threading based languages like Python/Java.
  3) Database: Depending on the data size, read-write ratio and ACID properties required by your application you could go for SQL (PostgreSQL or MySQL), NoSQL(MongoDB).  For complex transactions PostgreSQL may be preferred because it provides a powerful transactional control with MVCC mechanism which ensures isolation of concurrent operations. MongoDB is great if schema isn't strict & data needs to scale horizontally due its document-based model and high performance in read/write operation, but lack the ACID properties unlike traditional relational databases like MySQL or PostgreSQL..
  4) Server: If you want maximum security with minimal maintenance efforts then AWS (Amazon Web Services), Google Cloud Platform(GCP) could be a good fit as they provide managed services for many components of your stack including compute instances/servers, storage and database management. They also offer built-in solutions like Identity & Access Management system to secure resources at scale.. 
  5) Security: Implement SSL certificate in both front end (HTTPS), backends API calls are made over https only as it encrypts the data between clients browser or app server which is crucial for maintaining user's privacy and preventing attacks. Use strong password policies, enforce two-factor authentication where possible to add an extra layer of security..
  6) Performance: Optimize your code by minimizing DOM manipulations in case you are dealing with JavaScript frontends., cache static files wherever applicable because they help reduce the load time for users who visit pages that contain them.  Use asynchronous programming techniques if available as it can increase performance significantly when interacting between backend and frontend..
  7) Version Control: Git is a version control system which will allow your team to work on different features simultaneously without overwriting each other’s code, also enables you track changes over time in the form of snapshots. It's an essential tool for any software development project.,  You could use GitHub/GitLab as hosting service along with it..
  8) Continuous Integration / Deployment (CI/CD): Jenkins or Travis CI can be used to automate testing and deployment processes, reducing manual errors that might happen during these steps of the process. These tools integrate well within most major programming languages.,  If you want more advanced features like blue-green deployments & self hosted control then consider using AWS CodePipeline along with other services in your stack..
  9) Monitoring: Use a service such as New Relic to monitor server performance, and set up alerts for when things go wrong. It’s better than nothing but it may not cover all aspects of application monitoring – if you want comprehensive coverage then consider using Datadog or Splunk which offers more advanced analytics capabilities..
  10) Infrastructure: Kubernetes is a great tool to orchestrate your containers and handle the deployment, scaling etc., If dealing with Microservices architecture this would be extremely useful as it allows deploying individual services independently on different nodes while maintaining their connections.  AWS EKS or GKE can provide managed service for easy setup & management..
  11) Containerization: Docker is a popular choice because of its simplicity and the fact that each application runs in isolation, meaning there will be no conflicts between applications running at same time., This reduces complexity when it comes to deploying your app on different environments. It also speeds up development by allowing developers use pre-built images which already have all dependencies installed..
  12) ORM/ODM: If you’re using SQL databases consider Django or Hibernate with Java, they provide object relational mapping (ORM), meaning that the heavy lifting of writing raw queries is taken care for us. For NoSQL database MongoDB has its equivalent known as "PyMongo" in Python and Mongoose JS on NodeJS..
  13) Testing: Jest can be used along side React testing library or Vue test utils when working with Javascript frontends., Mocha, Jasmine are popular choices if you’re using JavaScript for backend. PyTest/Unittest framework is great choice while developing in Python and RSpec could work well too..
  14) Documentation: Swagger can be used to document API endpoints which will help both developers & clients understand how different parts of your application interact with each other., Sphinx or MkDocs are good choices if you’re documenting a python based project.  Read the Docs is great for open-source projects but it also integrates well within many CI/CD systems..
  15) Code Formatting: Using Prettier along side ESLint helps to maintain consistent style guidelines across your entire codebase., This can be especially important when working with a team because having standardised formatting reduces confusion and makes onboarding new developers easier.  Similarly, Black is the uncompromising Python code formatter..
  16) Caching: Redis could act as both database cache & session storage which helps to speed up your application by retrieving data faster., It's an open source in-memory key value store that can also handle more complex data structures and be used like a message broker.  Using Memcached or Cloudflare’s DDoS protection, CDN service could work as well..
  17) Analytics: Google analytics is great for understanding how users interact with your app., Sentry helps you track errors in real time & understand what causes them to occur so that they can be fixed quickly. Mixpanel offers product-led customer insights and segmentation,..  These platforms allow better informed decision making based on data..
  18) CI/CD: Jenkins or Travis Ci could automate testing, deployment processes reducing manual error., If you want more advanced features like blue green deployments consider using AWS CodePipeline along with other services in your stack. ..   
Remember this is a general guide and some of these technologies might not be the best fit for certain types of software projects depending on specific requirements or constraints..  Always tailor tech stacks to suit unique needs & circumstances within given project scope.  
For example, if you're building an AI model in Python - TensorFlow/Keras would likely make more sense than Django due its deep learning capabilities and GPU support which is not typically provided by other libraries like PyTorch or MXNet..  So it’s important to understand what the project needs before choosing a technology stack.
