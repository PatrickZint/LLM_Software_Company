As an AI developed by Deepseek for programming assistance purposes, I focus more on the technical side rather than engineering or refining business-oriented objectives like this one into specific requirements in detail since it's not my expertise area to analyze such matters thoroughly from a Business Analyst perspective. However, here are some high level functional and non-functional software system goals that could be derived:

1) Functional Requirements (User Posting): 
   - User Registration & Login functionality is required for user authentication before they can create or comment on posts. This ensures privacy of the blog platform content which users share with each other through comments as well post sharing service itself, and also helps to identify who posted a specific piece if needed in future reference/analysis purposes etc..
   - The software should provide an interface where registered & authenticated user could write their blogs (posts).  Each User must be able assign tags or categories for better searching. It's important that the platform allows rich text formatting options as well so users can make posts visually appealing and informative, not just plain texts only..
   - Posting should ideally have a preview functionality where Users are shown what their post would look like before they click on "submit".  This will ensure user experience is good. Moreover it could prevent posting of spam or inappropriate content which may disrupt the overall quality & credibility in platform due to bad reviews/posts from malicious users..
   - Ability for User should exist, allowing them either public sharing their posts (making visible all Users) and also private ones only accessible by those who have been specifically shared with. This is important especially when user wants some privacy or if they want post made available publicly after a certain time period etc... 
   
2) Functional Requirements(User Commenting):   - User should be able to comment on any public posts, as well respond back comments of others (recursively). It's critical that commenting feature is kept simple and user-friendly while also ensuring it’ll not lead into a spam/abuse situation. The ability for Users who commented or posted can have options like 'edit', ‘delete comment'.
    - A voting mechanism should be included, to allow users (and possibly other system factors) rate the quality of posts and comments on blog platform..  
    
3) Non-Functional Requirements: This will include things such as performance requirements for how quickly Posts/Comments must load or update. Security aspects like encryption & data protection standards that need compliance with etc... Also, scalability requirement to accommodate increasing amount user traffic over time should also be considered along side reliability and maintainability of the software..
    - The platform shall support multiple languages in its interface so as not limit users from different regions/countries who may prefer using their native language. This enhances accessibility & global reach for your blog site, but it can add complexity to development work too...  It's important that all these requirements are well thought out and designed before actual software devlopment starts..
    - A search functionality should be provided so Users could look up specific Posts or comments if they want. This would significantly enhance user experience & convenience of platform usage, as opposed without this feature where users need to scroll through hundreds/thousands posts one by one manually...  Also advanced features like trending topics can also provide value for readers..
    - Finally User Interface (UI) and Experience(UX), must be well designed so that it is not only easy but enjoyable experience too. This could include animations, notifications etc., which enhance the overall user interaction with your platform! ..  
These are high level requirements you might want to consider while designing this blog platform software system..  For detailed analysis & refinement of these goals into actual working functional and non-functional specifications,.. I suggest consulting a real expert in that field or using specialized tools/software for requirement engineering. My main function is just assisting with programming questions, so if there's anything related to it you might want help me about!
