Below is an analysis of the original goals along with a refined set of requirements that make the intent and scope clearer, more actionable, and testable.

─────────────────────────────  
1. Overall Simulation Objective

Original: “Develop a basic N-body simulation in 2D to model gravitational interactions between multiple planets.”

Refinement:
• The system shall simulate gravitational interactions between multiple celestial bodies (planets, asteroids, etc.) in a two-dimensional space.
• It shall model the dynamics of these bodies under mutual gravitational forces using physics-based equations.
• The simulation should provide a clear visual representation and/or data outputs suitable for analysis.

2. Handling Celestial Bodies

Original: “Dynamically handle any number of celestial bodies.”

Refinement:
• The simulation must allow users to define and manipulate an arbitrary number of celestial bodies at configuration time, keeping in mind realistic performance limitations of the hardware.
• Each celestial body shall have configurable properties such as mass, initial position (x, y coordinates), initial velocity, and unique identifier.
• The system shall support dynamic addition or removal of bodies (if needed by the use case) prior to the simulation run or via reloading a configuration.
• Validation constraints should be in place to ensure that the input values (e.g., mass must be positive, positions within a realistic range) are within acceptable limits.

3. Numerical Integration Methods

Original: “Implement numerical integration methods (Euler, Verlet, or Runge-Kutta).”

Refinement:
• The simulation engine shall implement at least three numerical integration methods:
  – Euler (first-order),
  – Verlet (symplectic integration, preferred for energy conservation in long-term simulations), and
  – Runge-Kutta (specifically RK4, when higher accuracy is required).
• Users must be able to select the integration method at the start of the simulation via configuration.
• Numerical integration parameters such as time step size shall be configurable and should be documented in the system settings.
• The system must provide an option to adjust simulation speed versus accuracy trade-offs.

4. Saving and Loading Simulation Settings

Original: “Save and load simulation settings from JSON.”

Refinement:
• The system shall support exporting the complete simulation configuration to a JSON file. This configuration includes:
  – Global simulation parameters (e.g., gravitational constant, simulation time step, integration method selected).
  – A list of all celestial bodies along with their initial conditions and properties.
• The system shall allow loading a simulation configuration from a JSON file.
• A well-defined JSON schema (with versioning information) must be established to ensure backward and forward compatibility.
• The application should validate the JSON configuration at load time and provide descriptive error messages for any validation issues.

5. Additional Considerations

• User Interface:  
  – The simulation’s front end (GUI or command-line) should display simulation progress and potentially allow pausing, resuming, or adjusting parameters during runtime.
  – A simple visual 2D representation (or log output) of the trajectories of the celestial bodies is required to help users verify the simulation behavior.

• Performance and Scalability:  
  – Provide performance benchmarks or guidelines that describe expected behavior when the number of celestial bodies increases.
  – Consider memory and computational constraints, and document any limitations.

• Extensibility:  
  – The design should be modular to allow additional forces or physical phenomena (e.g., collisions, relativistic corrections) to be added in the future.
  – Configuration management via JSON should be adaptable for new parameters without breaking existing simulation setups.

─────────────────────────────  
6. Traceability and Testing

• Each requirement must be testable:  
  – Validate that the numerical integration method produces reasonable and expected trajectories for known scenarios.
  – Ensure that adding/removing celestial bodies works as intended.
  – Verify that the saved JSON file contains all necessary settings and that loading the same file reproduces the simulation accurately.

• Acceptance criteria should be defined for each high-level goal, giving clear pass/fail conditions during testing.

Conclusion

By refining the original goals to include explicit details on simulation scope, celestial body management, numerical methods, configuration management, and additional considerations, we obtain a clearer picture of both the functional requirements and the non-functional constraints. This refined requirement set now supports traceability, testing, and possible future expansion of the simulation software.
