As an AI Programming Assistant based off the Deepseek's QSeek Coder model developed by OpenAI Inc., I will help in refining these requirements for your blogging system into more detailed user stories, functional specifications or even high-level design documents depending upon which stage of software development you are at. Here is how it can be done:

1. User Registration and Login – Users should have the ability to register an account on this platform by providing necessary information like username/email id & password along with optional details such as bio, profile picture etc. Registered users must also need login feature for access their profiles or write posts / comments later in time of usage.

2. Create a Post – After logged-in the user should have an option to create new blog post by providing title and body content which can include text/images as well, along with tags if applicable that helps users find relevant blogs easily on platform. Users must be able confirm whether their posts are created successfully or not after submission process ends due potentially occurring server issues etc.,
   
3. Comment System – Each post should have an integrated commenting system where authenticated user can type in any comments related to this specific blog, they also need the ability edit/delete only theirs comment but cannot modify others's one unless authorized by owner or admin of course..  
    4- User Profile Management - Registered users must be able view & manage their own profile (edit details such as username , email id etc.), except password which should remain hidden for security purpose. Users also need an option to delete the account permanently with all related data on this platform, including posts and comments created by them beforehand..
   5- Search Functionality – Implement a powerful search bar that can find blog post based upon tags or keywords used within those articles as well it should have user friendly highlighting feature for better readability of matched terms in results.  6 - Blog Post Viewing: Any registered users (or even public without registration) must be able view individual blogs by clicking on title from homepage / search result page etc..
   7- User Following/Follower System – Allow blogging community to follow other’s blog posts or get notifications when new post is published. This system should also track how many followers a user has and allow users themselves choose whether they want their each activity like publishing of any article visible on profile for all others..
   8- Blog Post Editing/Deletion: User must be able to edit & delete previously created blog posts, but only if not yet published. Once post is live i.e., public viewable then this option should become disabled (unless by admin).. 9 - Privacy Settings : Users may choose whether their profile and associated information(like email etc) will remain private or publicly visible for others..
   10- Blog Post Like/Dislike: Implement a feature that allows users to like / dislike posts. This feedback could be useful in understanding the popularity of different blog entries, as well helping other readers decide which ones might interest them most! 
   These are some essential functionalities you may want your blogging platform includes but this list can always get extended depending upon more specific requirements or future enhancements desired by users/developers.. I hope above points have clarified how to refine these goals into functional software specifications. If there's anything else, please let me know for further discussion!
