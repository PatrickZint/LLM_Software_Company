Sure! Here's an analysis for the given problem statement along with some refinements that could make this system more robust or user-friendly depending upon your needs: 

**Goal Analysis:** The main goals of such software include creating a platform where users can write and publish their own posts, as well comment on other people’s blog entries. Here are the requirements in detail along with additional refinements that could be considered during development :

1. **User Registration/Authentication**: Users should have an account to post or make comments which would require them to register first using email id and password for instance (optional: social media login). 
2. ***Post creation*** - Registered users must able create their own posts with a title, content of the blog(text only), tags if any etc.. There could be an option such as "public" or "private". If set to public then post can viewed by all else it should remain private and viewable for selected people.
3. ***Post Editing/Deletion*** - Registered users must have capabilities in editing their posts, but they also need the ability to delete them if necessary (with appropriate confirmation). 
4. **Commenting system**: Every blog post has a commenting section where registered user can comment on it along with options like replying or liking comments etc.. There should be validation for avoiding spam and inappropriate content through moderation tools in place which could flag these contents waiting approval from the admin before they are published to maintain quality of discussions/comments.
5. ***Profile Management*** - Registered users need capabilities such as editing their profile information (like display name, bio), changing password etc.. 
6. **Search functionality**: To help people find posts or topics related with specific keyword(s). It can be basic search bar where user could input a term and see relevant results based on the post's title/content tags along other factors like recent /popular blogs Etc…  
7. ***Privacy settings*** - Users should have control over their profile visibility, allowing them to set different privacy preferences for who sees what about them (publicly visible or only friends). 
8. **Notifications** : System could send notifications when there are comments on your posts/new followers etc.. It would help users stay updated with recent activity in the platform and engage more actively if they want, but also give flexibility to turn off these notification for those who prefer not be so intrusive or frequent updates . 
9. ***Social features***: The ability of user follow other bloggers’ accounts could improve engagement between them (if Blogger A follows blogger B then he/she will get notified about the new posts from him). This would also give additional insights into what type and trending topics people are discussing on platform which can be useful for admin to gain understanding their audience better.
10.*Security* - Secure login system, encrypted data etc..  For this you might want use SSL certificate in order maintain secure communication between user's browser/client-side app & your server(or backend). Also using HTTPS instead of HTTP will give more trustability as all the transmitted information would be scrambled and can’t read by unauthorized individuals.
11.*SEO* - Implementing proper SEO (Search Engine Optimization) could help in increasing visibility on search engine results, thereby driving traffic to site or blog post directly from Google/Bing etc..  This means including appropriate meta tags with descriptions which are relevant for each page(s), ensuring clean code without unnecessary elements slowing down loading times and using alt attributes correctly.
12.*Accessibility* - Ensure all content is readable by screen readers, images have 'alt' text to describe their function or purpose if not visible etc.. This will be helpful in making your platform inclusive & accessible for people with disabilities which also improves user experience overall! 
   
These are the general requirements and features that a blog system should ideally include. However these could vary based on specific business needs, target audience demographics/preferences , existing technology stack or capabilities of development team etc... So it's always advisable to involve end users in initial brainstorming phase & continuous user feedback during beta testing stage for gathering real-world insights and making improvements as necessary!
