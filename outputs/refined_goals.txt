  - Catch and handle any unforeseen runtime errors to prevent application crashes.
  - Log errors for debugging purposes (optional for future enhancements).

### **2.4 Additional Functionalities (Optional Enhancements)**

- **Keyboard Support:**
  - Allow users to perform operations using keyboard inputs in addition to button clicks.

- **Decimal Support:**
  - Enable calculations involving decimal numbers for more precise results.

- **History Feature:**
