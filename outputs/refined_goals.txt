Below is an analysis of the initial goals and a refined set of requirements for the N-body simulation software:

─────────────────────────────  
1. Analysis of Initial Goals

• Purpose:  
 – Simulate gravitational interactions in 2D using Newtonian physics.  
 – Focus on planets = “celestial bodies” with masses, positions, and velocities.

• Core functionalities:  
 – Physics Calculation: The simulation must compute forces between every pair of bodies (using Newton’s gravitational law), update velocities, and calculate new positions.  
 – Data Output: The simulation should output dynamic information (forces, positions, possibly velocities) for each time step, useful for debugging or analysis.  
 – Visualization: A real-time GUI-based 2D visualization is needed to display the simulation state.  
 – Flexibility: The system must support an arbitrary number of celestial bodies, added dynamically.

• Ambiguities and Potential Improvements:  
 – What integration method will be used (e.g., Euler, Verlet, Runge–Kutta)?  
 – How will users specify initial conditions for each body (masses, positions, velocities)?  
 – What form should the output take (log file, on-screen text, data export)?  
 – Should the simulation provide control features like pausing, stepping, or zooming?  
 – Are performance constraints expected when the number of bodies becomes large?

2. Refined Requirements

A. Functional Requirements

1. Simulation Engine  
 a. Physics Calculation  
  • RF-1.1: The engine shall compute gravitational forces using Newton’s gravitational formula (F = G * m1 * m2 / r²) for every pair of bodies.  
  • RF-1.2: The engine shall update velocities and positions based on the computed forces at each simulation time step.  
  • RF-1.3: The engine shall support selection (or future configuration) of an integration method (e.g., Euler’s method, Verlet integration, or Runge–Kutta) for updating simulation states.  
 b. Configurable Simulation Parameters  
  • RF-1.4: The simulation shall allow users to define initial conditions for each body (position, velocity, mass) via a configuration file or GUI input.  
  • RF-1.5: The system shall allow configuration of simulation parameters such as time step duration and gravitational constant (G).

2. Output and Logging  
 • RF-2.1: At each simulation step, the system shall output the following data:
   – Computed gravitational forces between bodies.
   – Updated positions and velocities for each body.
 • RF-2.2: The output data shall be timestamped by simulation time steps and stored in a structured format (e.g., CSV or JSON) for later review.
 • RF-2.3: Provide an option to display this information in the GUI (e.g., in a side panel or log window).

3. Graphical User Interface (GUI) and Visualization  
 a. Visualization  
  • RF-3.1: The system shall display a 2D visualization of the simulation in a dedicated GUI window.  
  • RF-3.2: Celestial bodies shall be rendered with appropriate scaling and distinct visual markers (e.g., size proportional to mass).  
  • RF-3.3: The visualization must update in real-time to reflect simulation progress.
 b. User Controls  
  • RF-3.4: The GUI shall provide basic controls to start, pause, resume, and stop the simulation.  
  • RF-3.5: The system should support interactive features such as zooming, panning, and optionally stepping through simulation frames for detailed analysis.

4. Dynamic Handling of Celestial Bodies  
 • RF-4.1: The system shall support the addition of new celestial bodies at runtime, updating the simulation calculations accordingly.  
 • RF-4.2: The system shall support removing or modifying bodies during runtime, ensuring the simulation remains stable.
 • RF-4.3: The simulation engine must handle an arbitrary number of bodies efficiently while considering performance (e.g., via optimization strategies or approximation techniques if needed in future revisions).

B. Nonfunctional Requirements

1. Performance  
 • RNF-1.1: The simulation must update in real-time for a reasonable number of bodies (e.g., 10–50), with clear plans to identify performance bottlenecks for larger numbers.
 • RNF-1.2: The code should be modular and optimized to allow later enhancement, including switching out numerical methods or algorithms.

2. Usability  
 • RNF-2.1: The GUI must be intuitive, providing clear feedback and controls to users.
 • RNF-2.2: Documentation and tooltips should be provided to explain simulation parameters and visual elements.

3. Extensibility and Maintainability  
 • RNF-3.1: The architecture shall be modular so that the physics engine, visualization, and data logging components can be modified or extended independently.
 • RNF-3.2: The code base should include unit tests for the simulation logic to ensure correctness.

The refined requirements now provide a clear specification for the simulation engine, its configuration options, comprehensive output, interactive visualization, and support for dynamic runtime changes. This clarity will guide the design and implementation phases, ensuring that developers and stakeholders share a common understanding of the project’s scope and functionalities.
