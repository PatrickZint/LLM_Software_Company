4. **Error Handling:**
   - **Division by Zero:** Detect attempts to divide by zero and display an appropriate error message.
   - **Invalid Input:** Handle non-numeric inputs or unexpected user actions gracefully, informing the user of the error.

5. **Additional Features (Optional for Refinement):**
   - **Clear Entry (CE) and All Clear (C):** Differentiate between clearing the current entry and resetting the entire calculation.
   - **Decimal Support:** Allow input and calculation of decimal numbers.
   - **Keyboard Shortcuts:** Enable keyboard interaction for faster input.

### **2.2 Non-Functional Requirements**

These outline the system's attributes and constraints.

1. **Performance:**
   - **Response Time:** Calculations and UI updates should occur instantaneously (within 1 second).
   - **Resource Usage:** The application should be lightweight, not consuming excessive system resources.

2. **Usability:**
   - **Intuitive Design:** Users should find the calculator easy to use without prior instructions.
   - **Accessibility:** Ensure that fonts are legible and buttons are appropriately sized for ease of use.

3. **Reliability:**
   - **Error-Free Operations:** Minimize bugs to ensure accurate calculations.
   - **Consistent Behavior:** The calculator should behave consistently across different sessions.

4. **Maintainability:**
   - **Code Readability:** Write clean, well-documented code to facilitate future updates.
   - **Modularity:** Structure the code in modular components for easier maintenance and scalability.

5. **Compatibility:**
   - **Operating Systems:** Primarily designed for major operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux) where Python and Tkinter are supported.
   - **Python Version:** Specify the Python version (e.g., Python 3.8+) to ensure compatibility.

6. **Security:**
   - **Input Sanitization:** Prevent potential code injection or malicious inputs, even though it's a calculator.

### **2.3 Constraints**

- **Technology Stack:**
  - **Programming Language:** Python
  - **GUI Library:** Tkinter (built-in with Python)
  
- **Development Timeline:**
  - Define specific milestones and deadlines for project phases (e.g., design, development, testing).

- **Resource Availability:**
  - Ensure access to necessary development tools and environments.

### **2.4 Assumptions**

- **User Knowledge:** Users have basic knowledge of using graphical applications.
- **Environment:** Users have the necessary Python environment set up if source code distribution is intended.
- **Single User Operation:** The calculator is intended for single-user use without concurrent access considerations.

### **2.5 Dependencies**

- **Python Installation:** Users must have Python installed if distributing the source code.
- **Tkinter Library:** Tkinter comes bundled with standard Python installations, but verifying its availability is essential.

## **3. Use Cases**

Outlining typical user interactions can help in refining requirements further.

### **3.1 Use Case 1: Perform an Addition**

- **Actor:** User
- **Precondition:** Calculator is open and ready for input.
- **Flow:**
  1. User enters the first number (e.g., 5).
  2. User presses the '+' button.
  3. User enters the second number (e.g., 3).
  4. User presses the '=' button.
  5. Calculator displays the result (8).

### **3.2 Use Case 2: Handle Division by Zero**

- **Actor:** User
- **Precondition:** Calculator is open and ready for input.
- **Flow:**
  1. User enters a number (e.g., 10).
  2. User presses the '÷' button.
  3. User enters zero (0).
  4. User presses the '=' button.
  5. Calculator displays an error message (e.g., "Error: Division by Zero").

### **3.3 Use Case 3: Invalid Input Handling**

- **Actor:** User
- **Precondition:** Calculator is open and ready for input.
- **Flow:**
  1. User attempts to input an invalid character (e.g., 'A').
  2. Calculator rejects the input and displays an error message (e.g., "Invalid Input").
