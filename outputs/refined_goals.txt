Below is a refined and expanded version of the initial goals, structured into clearer requirements. This version separates both functional and non-functional aspects and provides enough detail for further design and implementation:

1. Overall Goal:
 • Develop a lightweight, functional news reader application that retrieves top headlines from a public news API and presents them in an accessible, user-friendly interface.

2. Functional Requirements:
 a. API Integration:
  – The application must connect to a public news API to fetch the latest top headlines.
  – It must handle API responses gracefully, including error handling for cases like network failure or invalid responses.
 b. Home Screen UI:
  – The main screen should display a list (or feed) of news headlines.
  – Headlines should be displayed in an organized and scrollable list.
 c. Article Details Screen:
  – When a user taps on a headline, the application shall navigate to a detailed view.
  – The detailed view must display the full article details such as the headline, summary or content, publication date, source, and possibly an image if available.
 d. Configuration:
  – If necessary, create and manage required configuration files (such as API keys/configuration settings) to facilitate smooth operation.
  – Ensure that configuration settings can be easily modified for different environments (e.g., development, production).

3. Non-Functional Requirements:
 a. Lightweight & Performance:
  – The application must be optimized for speed and low memory usage.
  – It should load the headlines list quickly and smoothly.
 b. Usability:
  – The UI should be intuitive and easy to navigate for a broad user demographic.
  – Include visual feedback (e.g., loading indicators) during API calls.
 c. Maintainability:
  – Code organization should allow for easy updates, especially if the API or UI needs enhancements.
  – Ensure separation of concerns (e.g., separate modules for API handling and UI rendering).
 d. Reliability:
  – The application should handle intermittent network issues gracefully.
  – Implement simple caching (if deemed necessary) to improve user experience when connectivity is slow.

4. Additional Considerations:
 – Documentation: Provide clear documentation for setup, including configuration file editing and API key insertion.
 – Testing: Include basic unit tests to verify API integration, UI navigation, and configuration loading.
 – Platform: Clarify the target platform (e.g., web, mobile, desktop) to tailor UI and performance considerations accordingly.

This structured set of refined goals should serve as a basis for designing, implementing, and testing the application while ensuring that all necessary aspects are covered.
