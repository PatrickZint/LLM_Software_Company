- **Theming:** Provide options for different UI themes (e.g., light and dark mode).

### **3.2 Non-Functional Requirements**

#### **3.2.1 Usability**
- **Intuitive Design:** Users should navigate and operate the calculator without prior instructions.
- **Accessibility:** Ensure the application is accessible to users with disabilities (e.g., keyboard navigation, screen reader support).

#### **3.2.2 Performance**
- **Responsiveness:** User interactions (button clicks) should register within 100 milliseconds.
- **Efficiency:** Optimize the application to use minimal system resources.

#### **3.2.3 Reliability**
- **Accuracy:** All arithmetic operations must yield correct results.
- **Stability:** The application should run consistently without unexpected crashes.

#### **3.2.4 Compatibility**
- **Platform Support:** Ensure compatibility with major operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux) that support Tkinter.

#### **3.2.5 Maintainability**
- **Code Quality:** Write clean, well-documented code adhering to PEP 8 standards.
- **Modularity:** Structure the application into modules/components for easy maintenance and scalability.

### **3.3 Constraints**
- **Technology Stack:** Must use Python and Tkinter; no external GUI libraries.
- **Libraries:** Limit usage to Python Standard Library and Tkinter to ensure simplicity and reduce dependencies.
- **Timeframe:** Define a realistic timeline for development, testing, and deployment phases.

### **3.4 Assumptions**
- **User Environment:** Users have access to a desktop environment capable of running Python applications.
- **Python Installation:** Users have Python 3.6+ installed or the application includes an executable bundled with the required Python runtime.

## **4. Use Cases**

### **4.1 Basic Calculation**
**Actor:** User  
**Precondition:** Calculator application is open and ready.  
**Flow:**
1. User inputs the first number.
2. User selects an arithmetic operation.
3. User inputs the second number.
4. User presses the '=' button.
5. The application displays the result.

### **4.2 Handle Division by Zero**
**Actor:** User  
**Precondition:** Calculator application is open.  
**Flow:**
1. User inputs a number.
2. User selects the division operation.
3. User inputs zero.
4. User presses the '=' button.
5. The application displays an error message indicating division by zero is not allowed.

### **4.3 Clear Input**
**Actor:** User  
**Precondition:** User is in the middle of inputting a calculation.  
**Flow:**
1. User presses the 'C' (Clear) button.
2. The application clears the current input and resets the display.
