Below is an analysis of the provided goals along with suggestions for refining and expanding the requirements to make them more precise, testable, and implementable.

1. OVERALL GOAL

Original Goal: “Create a 3D gravitational simulation with collision detection.”

Refined Goal: Develop an interactive software system that simulates gravitational interactions among celestial bodies in a three-dimensional environment over time. The system should include accurate orbital dynamics, robust collision detection and resolution (with configurable outcomes), real-time 3D visualization, and data export capabilities.

2. FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

A. Simulation Engine and Physics Modeling  
• Requirement: The simulation should compute gravitational interactions between bodies using a Newtonian gravitational model (or optionally support alternative models such as relativistic corrections).  
  – Define:  
   • Bodies have physical properties such as mass, radius, initial velocity, and position.  
   • The gravitational force calculation and the time integration (e.g., using Runge-Kutta or Verlet integration) must be clearly specified.  
• Requirement: Support adjustable simulation parameters including time step, simulation duration, and precision settings.

B. Collision Detection and Resolution  
• Requirement: The system shall detect collisions between bodies based on their sizes (radii) and positions.  
• Requirement: When a collision is detected, allow for at least two modes of collision handling:  
  – Merge: Bodies combine into a single body, obeying conservation of mass, momentum, and optionally energy.  
  – Bounce: Bodies react according to either elastic or configurable inelastic collision dynamics.  
• Requirement: Provide user-selectable options for the collision handling mode and appropriate parameters (e.g., coefficient of restitution for bounces).

C. Data Export  
• Requirement: The application shall record the simulation state over time (positions, velocities, acceleration, energy, etc.) and enable exports in CSV and HDF5 formats.  
• Considerations:  
  – Define the frequency of logging (e.g., every simulation tick, user-determined intervals).  
  – Ensure that metadata (such as simulation start time, configuration options, units) is included in the export file.

D. Interactive 3D Visualization  
• Requirement: Provide an interactive 3D viewport for real-time visualization of the simulation.  
• Features:  
  – Allow users to pan, zoom, and rotate the camera view.  
  – Provide playback controls (start, pause, step-through, restart, and potentially adjust simulation speed).  
  – Optionally support selecting individual bodies to inspect properties (like current velocity and mass) and/or trace their trajectory.
• Requirement: Visualization should clearly differentiate bodies (e.g., colors, sizes) and optionally display trails or other indicators of movement.

3. NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

A. Performance and Scalability  
• Requirement: The software must efficiently support a realistic number of bodies (for instance, a minimum of 50–100 bodies) with real-time performance for the visualization component.  
• Requirement: The collision detection algorithm must scale gracefully. Techniques such as spatial partitioning or bounding volume hierarchies might be needed to ensure performance as the number of objects increases.

B. Usability  
• Requirement: Provide a user-friendly interface for simulation setup, including the ability to define initial conditions (e.g., number of bodies, positions, velocities, masses) and simulation parameters.  
• Requirement: Documentation and on-screen help should be provided to explain how to operate the simulation and export data.

C. Reliability and Accuracy  
• Requirement: Accuracy in the gravitational and collision calculations should be maintained, with adjustable tolerances for numerical integration to allow users to balance between computational speed and simulation fidelity.  
• Requirement: Robust error handling and logging should be incorporated so that invalid inputs or simulation instabilities are reported clearly.

D. Extensibility  
• Consider supporting plugin or configuration file approaches so that researchers or advanced users might extend the physics models (e.g., introducing additional forces or alternative collision handling models) without modifying the core system.

4. ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS

• Testing: Define test cases for gravitational dynamics, collision events (both merge and bounce scenarios), data export correctness, and UI/interaction functionality.  
• Configuration Management: Decide if the simulation settings will be saved persistently between sessions.  
• Platform: Decide on target platforms (desktop, web) and consider hardware acceleration for 3D rendering (e.g., leveraging OpenGL, WebGL, or a game engine framework).

5. SUMMARY

The refined requirements now clearly capture:
– How the gravitational simulation should work, including physics models and numerical methods.
– How collision detection is to be implemented and configured (with two distinct modes).
– The specifics of data export formats and what simulation information should be retained.
– The interactive 3D visualization features and controls expected.
– Non-functional aspects such as performance, usability, reliability, and scalability.

These refined requirements will help guide detailed design, implementation, and testing, ensuring that all stakeholders have a clear understanding of both the functionality and the constraints of the intended system.
