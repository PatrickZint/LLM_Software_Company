As an AI model focused solely in computer programming tasks, I don't have the ability directly to create or design new systems but here is how you could potentially structure requirements for this project based off your brief description of it being "a blog platform where users can write Posts and comment on other posts." 

1. **User Registration/Authentication:** Users must be able to register an account, login into their accounts securely with credentials (username or email address & password), manage user profiles including uploading a profile picture etc., logout functionality is also needed for security reasons. Resetting passwords should not only reset the current one but require re-confirmation after it’s changed as well so that no third parties can take over an account unintentionally
 
2. **Posting:** Registered users must be able to post blogs, including a title and content of their choice with images or files attached if necessary (but this would depend on the platform's capacity). Each blog should have its own unique URL for sharing purposes as well as SEO benefits.  
    - Post creation date & time – it will allow users/admins to track when posts were made and manage them accordingly, like scheduling future post publication or deleting old ones if needed; this also helps with the website's content management system (CMS).    
      Each blog should have a unique URL for easy sharing.  
    - Categories & tags – these will allow users/admins to organize their blogs into various groups and make it easier on themselves, as well as other readers who can filter through posts by category or tag.      
        The categories must be defined before the user starts creating a blog post so they have options while writing new ones later; likewise with tags which would require users/admins to input them manually during each creation process because there isn't an inherent predefined list of possible values for these fields like we do in category.   
 
3. **Commenting:** Registered and unregistered (guest) readers should be able comment on any blog post, including their own; this allows conversation about individual blogs without cluttering up discussion forums separately or taking away from the main content area by having too many comments per page etc., it also gives instant feedback/engagement to writers who share fascinating insights via articles!    
    The system must allow for nested commenting (i.e users can reply directly within each other’s comment) but moderation is required so inappropriate language or spam does not flood the thread and disrupt conversation flow, this could be done automatically using AI-based detection algorithms as well manually by admin/moderators when necessary 
    Users should also have control over their comments; they must able to edit them before publishing (to correct mistakes), delete a comment if it's no longer needed or even block other users from responding beneath your own post for privacy reasons.    
   Commenting functionality can be further expanded with features such as likes, shares and repost options which allow readers more engagement tools than simply writing their opinion directly into the conversation – this could lead to increased user interaction!   
       
4. **User Control over Their Posts/Comments:** Registered users must have control of everything they post; edit or delete any blog posts & comments at will, without needing permission from other people involved in those discussions (unless specifically given by them). This includes their right not just as an author but also a commenter – having no one else's opinion affect what you write on your own space.   
   It’s important to note that admins or moderators should never be able remove users entirely from this platform based solely because of something they wrote unless it violated our code (which would trigger the removal process).    
       
5. **Moderation:** An automated system needs to monitor comments/posts for inappropriate language, spam etc., and a manual review function where admins can approve or reject any new posts & comment manually before being visible on blog site itself which could potentially save hours of time spent filtering through every single post ourselves as an admin; this will ensure that our platform is always clean&respectful in terms content too.   
   This moderation system must also have a feature where it notifies users about any comments or posts they've made being flagged by the automated filter for review/moderation, allowing them to respond directly (within reason) before their work gets taken down entirely! 
       
6. **Privacy Settings:** Users should be able control how much of themselves is visible on this platform; decide what friends can see in your profile picture or status updates etc., as well whether they want all strangers visiting & interacting freely with them directly through comments, posts and direct message systems (which would require setting up another feature like 'private blog' for such individuals).   
   The same should apply to other users viewing their blogs – only seeing public information about author unless explicitly given permission by user themselves.    
       
7. **Notifications:** Users must be able see real time notifications when people are interacting with them on this platform; these can include new comments under a post they've written, likes/shares of theirs or even direct messages if those features were implemented later down line.. This feature would create an engaging environment where users stay engaged because there’s always something happening! 
       Moreover such notifications could also provide better visibility to readers about what discussions are going on right now by showing recent posts and comments in real time so they don't miss out any important information/activity within our community.   
       
8. **Search Functionality:** A search bar must be provided where users can type keywords or phrases related Blogs, authors etc., to quickly find specific items of interest on platform without having scroll through whole list manually one by one!  This would make navigating this huge database much more efficient and user-friendly..   
        Also it will enhance the overall experience for those who are looking specifically something particular rather than browsing casually just because "it's there".  
        
9. **SEO Optimization:** The platform should be optimized to boost visibility on search engines so that potential readers/users can easily find your articles when searching relevant topics using keywords..    For this we might need metadata tags for every post, sitemaps etc., – all features designed specifically with SEO in mind!  
         These enhancements would make our blog more discoverable by a larger audience and potentially help drive organic traffic to it.      
    10. **Performance Optimization:** The platform should be optimized so that pages load quickly on users' devices, regardless of the device type or internet speed.. This will improve user experience & satisfaction as well positively impact search ranking (another form optimization).. For this we might need lazy loading images/videos , image compression etc., 
    11. **User Engagement Metrics:** We should track metrics such as number posts per day /week, average comments on each post or even how long someone is sticking around before deciding to leave our site.. These insights could help guide future decisions about design improvements & feature prioritization based off actual user behavior!   Also this would enhance the overall experience for those who are looking specifically something particular rather than browsing casually just because "it's there".
    12. **Mobile Responsive Design:** The blog platform should be designed in a way that is easily accessible and usable on all devices (mobile, tablet & desktop).. This will ensure maximum reach as many people use their phones or tablets for internet these days compared to traditional computers..    And it would also provide better user experience! 
    13. **Social Media Sharing:** Users should be able share individual posts via popular social media platforms such Facebook and Twitter directly from our blog platform without having switch tabs/windows,.. This feature can significantly boost visibility & engagement as users might want to quickly show off their favorite content on these networks immediately after reading it here..
    14. **User Profile Customization:** Users should be able personalize profile page with bio, avatar (profile picture).. And also customize appearance of blog posts either dark or light theme,.. This feature would enhance user experience and make our platform feel more like a home for them rather than just another website in sea digital jungle..
    15. **Analytics Dashboard** : There should be an analytics dashboard to track important metrics such as number views per post, top 3 popular posts etc., Also it could include heat maps of where users are clicking on the page (to help guide future improvements).. This would allow us understand more about our audience’s behavior and make better data-driven decisions in terms feature development & marketing efforts..
    16. **User Support:** A ticketing system for user support to report problems or give feedback,.. Also a community forum where users can ask questions, share ideas,.. It will foster engagement with the platform by allowing them feel heard/valued and make it easier solve any issues they might have without needing direct interaction from admins..
    17. **Multi-language Support** : Allowing blog posts to be written in multiple languages (not just English).. This feature can attract a larger audience as many people don’t necessarily speak or write english,.. And also helps make platform more accessible for non native speakers by providing an additional layer of engagement.. 
    18. **Privacy Policy and Terms & Conditions** : A clear, concise privacy policy that users must agree to before creating account (to protect their personal info).. Also include a terms&conditions page outlining rules user should follow when using platform,.. It is important for maintaining trust with our audience by making them aware what kind of behaviors will result in being banned or removed from site..
    19. **Subscription/RSS Feed** : Allow users to subscribe via RSS feed (standard way syndicating blog content).. This feature can help reach a broader, long tail traffic,.. And it’s also good practice for professional bloggers as they often use this method keep their audience informed about new posts without having manually check site regularly..
    20. **Security** : The platform should ensure all data stored and transmitted are encrypted (both at rest & in transit).. This is crucial to maintain user trust,.. Also, it's a legal requirement for certain countries/regions,.. And overall good practice as we don’t want expose personal info of our users due potential security vulnerabilities..
    21. **Accessibility** : The platform should be designed with accessibility principles (like color contrast ratio).. This feature will make sure all types people can use it properly without any disability,.. It is a legal requirement for certain countries/regions,.. And overall good practice as we don’t want exclude anyone from using our service due potential lack of accessible features..
    22. **Infrastructure & Scalability** : The platform should be built on reliable infrastructure (like AWS, Google Cloud).. This feature will ensure the website can handle large traffic without any performance degradation,.. And also it's important to future-proof system so we don’t run into scalability issues down line when user base keep growing..
    23. **Advertising/Monetization** : A platform should have options for monetizing like ads (either display or text) placement on blog posts,... This can help cover costs of running site,.. Also, it's a good way to generate revenue from the hard work users are doing by creating and sharing their content..
    24. **Cross Platform Compatibility** : The platform should be compatible with all major browsers (like Chrome, Firefox etc.,) as well on different OS systems like Windows,... This feature will ensure maximum reach of our website,.. As many people still prefer using older browser version or specific operating system versions for various reasons..
    25. **SEO Friendly URLs** : The platform should use SEO friendly URL structure so it’s easier to remember and share (like www.exampleblogplatform.com/user-name/post-title).. This feature will improve visibility on search engines,.. As many factors that influence ranking are based directly or indirectly links from other websites..
    26. **Social Login** : Allowing users sign up using social media accounts like Facebook, Google,... It's a quick and convenient way for new visitors to try out our platform without having create account manually,.. Also can help us understand more about user’s behavior & preferences when connected with their personal data in these platforms..
    27. **Responsive Images** : The blog posts should be designed responsive so they look good on all devices,... This feature will ensure better engagement and conversion rate from the website as people are likely to spend longer time if content looks well presented,.. Also it's important for SEO because Google heavily favors websites which provides a great user experience (UX)..
    28. **User Friendly Dashboard** : A dashboard where users can easily manage their blog posts, view analytics data,... It will make the overall process of using platform more efficient and less tedious,.. As many people are busy with work/school then they would prefer quick & easy way to create or update content rather than spending hours figuring out complex interface..
    29. **Tag Cloud** : A visual representation (like word cloud) on front page showing most popular tags used in blog posts,... This feature can attract readers interested those topics,.. Also helps improve SEO by making search engines easier understand what kind of content is available on website as they could quickly scan this tag cloud to see if there are relevant keywords..
    30. **Version Control System** : Implement a version control system for managing different versions blog posts,... This feature can help in case need revert back changes or compare differences between two revisions,.. Also it's good practice when working on team as helps prevent overwrite someone else’s work unintentionally and makes collaboration easier..
    31. **Mobile Version of Website** : A separate mobile version website for better user experience,... This feature will ensure our content is accessible to everyone regardless if they are using desktop or smartphone,.. And also improve overall SEO ranking by showing search engines we have designed a responsive design that caters both desktop and mobile users..
    32. **Content Moderation Tools** : Provide tools like spam filters, comment moderation features,... This feature can help maintain good quality discussions on platform,.. Also helps prevent abuse of our service (like posting inappropriate content or getting spammed).. 
   These are the requirements for such a system to function properly and optimally in order provide an efficient blogging experience. It's important however that these must be prioritized based off user feedback, analytics data & current technological advancements so we continually improve platform over time..    Please note: Some features might need additional development or integration with other services (like email service for password reset,...).
