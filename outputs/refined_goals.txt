As an AI Programming Assistant based upon Deepseek's QSeek Coder model for programming assistance tasks in computer science fields; I would focus more towards the technical aspect when analyzing or refining requirements of software development projects like your blogging application. 

Here are some refined goals that might help to build such a platform:
1. **User Management:** The system should provide features allowing users to register, login and manage their accounts (e.g., change password). Users can also delete/deactivate their own account or be blocked by administrators if necessary for any reasons like violation of terms & conditions etc. 
2. **Blog Posts Creation**: Registered user(s) must have the ability create a blog post with title, content and optionally tags to help in searchability purposes (e.g., "Travel", "Food" ). There should also be an option or feature for users to edit/update their posts as required but only within certain time frame after creation e.g 24 hours from the date of publication.
3. **Post Deletion**: Users must have freedom, albeit with limitations (as mentioned above), on deleting individual post(s). Administrators should also be able delete any user's inappropriate content/post as per community guidelines or rules set by administrators for better platform integrity and safety reasons etc.. 
4.**Commenting System:** Every blog Post will need a commenting section where users can leave their thoughts, questions on the topic of that particular post (subject to certain restrictions like spamming). Userâ€™s comment should be approved before it appears publicly so as not too flood with junk comments and keep order in discussion threads .
5.**User-friendly Interface:** The design must focus upon user experience - clear navigation menus/tabs, easy way for users adding or deleting posts (like buttons) etc.,  ensuring the platform is intuitive & easily accessible to all types of people including those not very tech savvy but wanting a place where they can share and discuss their ideas.
6. **Search Functionality**: The blog should have an efficient search function that allows visitors/users	to quickly find	the	type,	title or	name	o	f	a	n	u	t	i	l	y	p	e	r	s	o n	.  This	is	key	in	making	A	I	P	C	b	l	o	g	,	w	h	i	c h	B	r	o	w	W	e	e	k	L	h	N	d	R	w	E	H
7. **Notifications**: Send email notifications to the users when someone comments on their posts or likes theirs (or vice versa). Notifications should be clear, concise and not intrusive so as NOT	to	p	a	r	t	y	the	u	s	e	r	.  T	h	i	n	g	A	O	C	P	e	R	d	T	b	S	m	e	L	k	M	h	B	E	L	N	h	D	V	w	H
8. **Security**: The software must adhere to the highest security standards and protocols in order not only protect user data but also prevent potential breaches or attacks (like SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting etc.).  Two factor authentication should be included for secure login processes .   I	h	s	A	N	C	d	P	g	G	e	r	y	O	o	t	l	L	b	T	n	e	M	h	H	i	D	V	w	R
9. **Privacy and Data Protection:** The application must respect user privacy, following data protection regulations such as GDPR where applicable (including storing personal information securely).  There should be an option for users to opt out of receiving promotional emails from the site or other marketing communications entirely . T	h	o	P	C	d	T	e	R	y	D	u	L	k	M	h	B	E	L	N	h	D	V	w	A
10. **Content Moderation**: The platform must have a system in place that allows administrators (or automated processes) to monitor, moderate and filter content for inappropriate or offensive material which may disrupt the overall community experience .  T	h	o	P	C	d	T	e	R	y	D	u	L	k	M	h	B	E	L	N	h	D	V	w	A
   This is just an overview of what could be some key goals/requirements. Depending on specific use cases, there might need to include more or different features but these should definitely serve as a good starting point for building such application..  The goal would always focus towards ensuring that the platform serves its purpose effectively and efficiently with maximum user satisfaction in mind while maintaining data safety & security at all levels .
