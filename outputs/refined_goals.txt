## **6. Use Cases**

### **6.1. Basic Calculation**

**Actor:** User  
**Description:** Perform a simple arithmetic operation (e.g., addition).  
**Steps:**
1. User inputs the first number.
2. User selects the desired operation (e.g., +).
3. User inputs the second number.
4. User presses the equals (=) button.
5. System displays the result.

### **6.2. Handling Division by Zero**

**Steps:**
1. User inputs a number with a decimal point (e.g., 5.).
2. User attempts to input another decimal point (e.g., 5..).
