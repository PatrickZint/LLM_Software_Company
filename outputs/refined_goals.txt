**Requirements Analysis and Refinement for a Python-Based Simple Calculator**

---

### **1. Introduction**

The objective is to develop a simple calculator application using Python. The calculator will provide a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Additionally, the application must handle common errors gracefully, such as division by zero and invalid user inputs. The proposed GUI will utilize the Tkinter library.

### **2. Initial Goals Assessment**

**Provided Goals:**
1. Develop a simple calculator in Python.
2. Implement a user interface for basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
3. Handle errors like division by zero and invalid inputs.
4. Use Tkinter to create a graphical user interface.

**Assessment:**
- **Clarity:** The goals are generally clear but lack specificity in certain areas (e.g., user interface design details, specific error handling mechanisms).
- **Completeness:** Covers primary functional aspects but misses out on non-functional requirements (e.g., performance, usability, portability).
- **Feasibility:** Achievable with the given tools and constraints.
- **Testability:** Without detailed requirements, creating comprehensive test cases may be challenging.
