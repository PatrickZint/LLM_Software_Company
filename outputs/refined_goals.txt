As an AI programming assistant model based off Deepseek's QSeek Coder (which focuses more towards solving code-based problems), my main focus lies in analyzing the technical aspects of your requirements instead of refining business goals or strategic planning for software development projects like a requirement engineer would do. 

However, I can certainly help you refine these functional and user experience related objectives into specific system features that could be used to develop such blog platform:

1. User Account Management - Users should have the ability to register an account with unique username/email & password; log in / logout functionality is necessary for secure access control. 
2. Post Creation Feature- Registered users must possess a feature allowing them post blogs or articles, possibly limited by character count and content type (text only vs text+images).
3. Commenting System - A commenting system should allow logged user to interact with the blog posts made available on platform; these comments could be either public/visible for all site visitors OR private /only visible within specific post's author & commenter(if set as such) – this may depend upon privacy settings of users.
4. User Profile - Each registered account should have an associated profile page that displays the user’s posts, comments and other information like their bio or social media links for authenticity checks/community building purposes.. Also a feature to edit these details would be great!  
5. Search Feature – A search bar could allow users & visitors easily find specific blog post(s) based on keywords / categories etc...   
6. Social Media Integration - Optionally, the platform can integrate with social media platforms for sharing posts directly from our blogging site to FB/Twitter or other supported networks (if allowed by user privacy settings). 
7. Security Measures- All data should be encrypted & protected against threats like SQL injections and XSS attacks; passwords must follow strong security policies including but not limited to length, complexity requirements etc..  
8. Responsive Design - The platform is expected on all devices such as desktop computers , tablets or mobile phones which requires a responsive design for consistent user experience across these platforms – This could also help in SEO optimization!   
9. Notifications System: For example when someone comments under your post, you should receive an email / push notification etc...  
10 . Moderation Tools- Implementing tools that allow admins/moderators to monitor and manage content posted on the blog (e.g., delete inappropriate posts or block users). 
Please note this is just a starting point for refining your goals, depending upon more specific requirements you might need additional features like SEO optimization , analytics integration etc.. Also remember user experience should always be top priority while developing such software solutions!   Let's discuss further if any other aspects are needed.
