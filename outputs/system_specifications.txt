Functional Requirements for User Management System in Blog Platform  :  
1. Users should be able to register with the platform using a unique email ID and password (with encryption).   
2. Registered users must have an option to log into their account securely via login page, including recovery options if they forget passwords .    
3. The system will allow registered user accounts access levels like 'admin', ‘moderator’ or general "user".  
4. Users should be able manage and update profile details such as name & email ID; however only by themselves not any other users/ admins without their explicit permission (data-hiding principle).   
5. User account must have options to delete the entire account along with all related posts, comments etc..  This action will remove them from platform permanently after confirmation dialogue(user security feature) .  
6. A user should be able view other users profiles including their post history and comment activity but not any sensitive details like password or email address (data privacy).    
7. The system must include a mechanism for reporting inappropriate content/ comments, which would require the involvement of an admin to review & take appropriate action .  
8. User rating feature should be incorporated so users can rate posts based on their quality and usefulness.. 
9. Implement user feedback module where Users could give suggestions or report bugs in application that will help improve platform experience for all future visitors/users (user satisfaction).   
10. A system to track the activity of a User like login history, post creation & comments etc should be implemented as well .  
Functional Requirements related Post Management: 
These requirements pertain more towards managing posts and associated actions on Blog Platform :    
a) Users can create new blog entries with title/content; these will include certain metadata such date of publishing or last update.   
b) Every post created should have an option for users to delete their own blogs, after confirmation dialog (user security feature).  Updating existing posts content is also allowed by the user .  
c) Users can view other’s blog entries and comments associated with it but not edit/delete unless they are author of that particular entry.   
d) Implementing moderation controls where admin or moderators have access to approve, reject post based on certain criteria like quality & relevance (if required).  These actions should be clearly notified back the user who created blog entries .  
e) For every new comment posted by a User it must trigger an email notification about this activity/commenting action if option is enabled in settings.   
Non-Functional Requirements:     
1. The system will support multiple simultaneous users and requests without any noticeable drop or slow down of performance (scalability).  
2. Secure data transmission over network using SSL for communication between client & server sides ensuring that all user’s private information are encrypted during transit .    
3. System must be highly reliable, meaning it should operate continuously with minimal downtime; in case if any failure occurs we need to have proper monitoring system (uptime).  
4. The database design of the application is normalized upto third normal form(3NF) for efficient management & retrieval process..   
5. Users' data will be stored securely and encrypted using strong encryption algorithms like AES 256-bit with hashing techniques such as SHA, ensuring minimum risk to user privacy (security).  
6. The platform must handle a large volume of traffic efficiently without compromising performance or responsiveness for end users(performance) .   
7. User interface should be designed keeping the principle "simplicity is better than complexity" , intuitive & easy-to use by all age groups and technological backgrounds..  It also needs to comply with international standards like WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines).  
8. All logs including system, user actions must have audit trails for future reference or in case of any incident investigation purpose(logging requirement)..   
9. The platform should be designed as a microservice architecture where each functionality is independent and can scale independently according to demand .  This will make the application more resilient , scalable & manageable over time (scalability).  
10. System must support multi-language interface, so that users from different geographical regions or with diverse language proficiency could use it comfortably(internationalization requirement)..   
System Design Recommendations:    
Following are recommendations based on software engineering principles and best practices :     
a) The system should be designed to follow MVC (Model View Controller), a design pattern which helps in managing the complexity of applications.  
b) Use REST API for communication between client & server sides , ensuring that data is transferred efficiently without any loss or slow down .   
c) For front-end, we can use modern frameworks like ReactJS/Angular to create single page application (SPA), improving user experience by reducing loading times..    
d) Back-End should be developed using Node.js for its event driven nature and non blocking I/O model making it perfect choice for data-intensive real time applications .  
e) To ensure fault tolerance & high availability, we can deploy our services on cloud platforms like AWS or Google Cloud with auto scaling feature enabled..     
f) Use a combination of relational databases (like PostgreSQL , MySQL etc.) and NoSQL database(s), based upon specific use cases.   
g) For caching mechanism Redis could be used as it is in-memory data structure store, providing high performance .  It'll cache frequent read queries reducing load on our main storage systems like SQL server..    
h) Use Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD), tools Jenkins for efficient software delivery process.   This will allow code changes to be regularly and continuously integrated into a short-lived development cycle, which can then automatically deploy the application if tests pass .  It'll also help in monitoring our system health & performance over time by providing realtime metrics ..   
i) For Database migration we should use Flyway or Liquibase. They both are tools for tracking and executing database schema changes ensuring data consistency..    
j) Implementing Automated Testing (Unit, Integration), code reviews to ensure quality of application before deployment which will help in early identification & fixing issues , improving reliability .  K) Finally keep monitoring our system using suitable tool like Prometheus or Grafana that can provide insights into the performance and health status.   These steps together would result a robust Blogging platform meeting all functional as well non-functional requirements..
