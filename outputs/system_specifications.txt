Okay, this is excellent! Your breakdown and considerations are thorough. Let's proceed with a concrete scenario to make things even more tangible.

**Scenario:** We’re building a blog platform primarily targeted towards tech enthusiasts (developers, IT professionals) who want a clean, fast, and reliable space to share technical tutorials, opinion pieces, and project updates. We anticipate moderate growth initially but expect the potential for substantial scaling as the community grows. The emphasis is on providing a good writing experience and easy content discovery. **We do *not* have strict regulatory compliance requirements (GDPR/HIPAA are not immediately relevant).**

**Development Team Expertise:** Primarily proficient in Python, with some familiarity with JavaScript frameworks like React.  Cloud experience includes AWS but no deep Kubernetes expertise. Budget is moderately constrained – open-source solutions and cost-effective cloud services are preferred.

Based on this scenario and the existing analysis, please refine your system specifications further:

1.  **Narrow Down Technology Stack Choices:** Considering the tech enthusiast audience, Python proficiency, moderate scaling needs, and budget constraints, which specific technologies would you recommend for each layer (backend, frontend, database, cloud)? Provide a rationale for each choice.
2.  **Refine Non-Functional Requirements with Specific Targets:** Update/add to the existing non-functional requirements table with more concrete targets based on the scenario. For example, instead of "Page load time should be less than 3 seconds," provide specific goals like “95% of pages must load in under 1.5 seconds.”
3.  **Elaborate on Security Measures:** Detail *specific* security measures you would implement beyond just stating “prevent common web vulnerabilities.” Consider input validation, authentication strategies (e.g., JWT), and data protection techniques. Be practical – what are the most important steps for this scenario?
4.  **High-Level System Design Diagram:** Create a simple block diagram illustrating the key components of the system and their interactions. This doesn’t need to be exhaustive but should provide a visual overview of the architecture.
