Based on the refined goals of creating a blog platform that emphasizes user experience along with functional requirements such as account management, post creation and commenting system etc., here are some detailed specifications. 

Functional Requirements (FR): These describe what functions should be performed by your software to meet business needs or customer expectations effectively. They're more about the 'What', rather than how it is accomplished:  
1. User Account Management FRs : Users must have ability for registration, login/logout functionality with unique username & email address and password security features (minimum length requirement etc.). The system should also provide a mechanism to reset forgotten passwords or change existing ones securely via secure links sent on registered emails only after verification of identity through OTP(One-Time Password).
2. Post Creation FRs : Registered users must have an option/feature for creating blog posts with limitation based upon character count (maximum limit could be decided depending up the content type – text or images etc.). There should also exist validation checks to avoid spam post creation and potential misuse of platform by unregistered individuals..
3. Commenting System FRs : Users must have an option/feature for commenting on posts, allowing them interact with other users' blog entries; comments could be set as either public (visible across all site visitors) or private(only between the commenter & author).. There should also exist validation checks to avoid misuse and spamming of platform.
4. User Profile FRs : Each user must have an associated profile page which displays their posts,comments etc., Providing a feature for users edit this information would be great..  A search bar can facilitate quick access based on keywords or categories within the blog content/title only (not personal info).  
5. Social Media Integration: If allowed by privacy settings of user & platform's policy , an option to share posts directly from our blogging site onto social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter could be provided..  This feature must respect all relevant laws and regulations concerning data protection as well the policies set forth in each respective service’s API usage agreement.
6. Security Measures FR: All user-generated content should undergo sanitization before display to prevent potential code injection attacks etc., User passwords need complexity requirements including minimum length, special characters inclusion & periodic rotation of password for additional security..  Data encryption and protection against SQL injections/XSS attack mechanisms must be in place during data storage or transfer.
7. Responsive Design FR: The platform should work seamlessly across different devices (Desktops , tablets etc.) to ensure a consistent user experience, SEO optimization could also benefit from this approach as it enhances discoverability on search engines..  Notifications System like email/push notifications when someone comments under your post would improve the overall User Experience.
8. Moderation Tools FR: A system should be in place for admins or moderators who can monitor and manage content posted, potentially deleting inappropriate posts along with blocking users if necessary based upon platform's policies & guidelines..  This feature must respect all relevant laws regarding freedom of expression while preventing misuse/abuse on the part either by individuals creating such material themselves OR others exploiting system vulnerabilities.
   
Non-Functional Requirements (NFR): These describe qualities that are important to our software but not directly related with its functionality, like performance or usability etc..  The emphasis here is more upon 'How', rather than what it should accomplish:  
1. Performance NFRs : Load time for pages needs to be optimized efficiently without compromising user experience; system responsiveness must remain consistent under varying loads/conditions (peak hours). Also consider implementing caching mechanisms where necessary or using database indexing strategies etc..  Database performance can also significantly impact the overall application speed, so appropriate optimization should ideally occur.
2. Usability NFRs : The interface needs to be intuitive and easy-to-use for new users; system must provide clear instructions/guidance on how it works which could potentially decrease support costs due less calls or emails about confusion over platform’s functionality..  Also, consider using user testing & feedback loops during development stages as they can greatly improve the overall usability of your product.
3. Scalability NFR: If expected traffic increases significantly (i.e., viral growth), system should be able to scale up effectively without compromising performance or quality; new features could also potentially need added support for scalability..  The chosen tech stack needs consideration in terms its ability and efficiency with scaling as well, ensuring it can handle increasing loads/traffic gracefully over time regardless if additional servers are required.
4. Security NFR: As outlined previously , security is a key concern so must be taken seriously from design phase; system should have built-in features for regular vulnerability scanning & patching in order to stay secure against common threats..  Also, ensure all employees involved (from developers and admins) understand their roles regarding cybersecurity measures along with protocols they need follow during development process.
5. Maintainability NFR: Code must be well structured/modularized allowing it easy debugging or modifications; comments should provide sufficient context for understanding complex parts of the codebase.. Also, consider adopting coding standards & best practices to ensure maintainable and clean-up codes in future revisions when necessary (like refactoring)..  Finally , any third party tools used within development process need consideration upon whether they can be upgraded/replaced with new ones without major impact on current functionalities or system.
6. Compliance NFR: System must comply strictly according all relevant laws & regulations concerning data protection, privacy etc., respecting user's rights and not infringing anyone else’s intellectual property.. Also any changes in these rules (like GDPR implementation) should be able to adapt quickly without much impact on existing functionalities or system architecture itself. 
7. Availability NFR: System must guarantee a high level of availability; this could involve setting up multiple data centers with failover mechanisms, using load balancers etc., ensuring minimal downtime during maintenance windows.. Also consider how the application will react in case one part fails and another has to take over immediately without impacting end users experience or productivity. 
8. Portability NFR: System should be able run on different platforms (Linux/Windows) & use multiple languages(Java, Python etc.) with minimal changes; this can save time during development process when working across various environments.. Also consider how easily application could migrate from one technology stack to another if necessary due potential future tech upgrades or strategic decision.
    For example , in the case of a change towards microservices architecture which would be more complex than current system, having portability will allow smoother transition and reduce time spent on rewrites/refactors during migration process..  The chosen programming languages need consideration upon its ability & efficiency with different operating systems as well considering it can handle increasing loads gracefully over period.
    Furthermore , ensure compatibility of application across various devices (Desktops , tablets etc.) using responsive design principles for better user experience and SEO optimization which enhances discoverability on search engines..  This will be an added advantage if platform is used to share content online or as part promotional activities, boosting its reach among wider audience.
    The system should also have a strong backup solution in place so that it can recover from any data loss scenarios without affecting the business operations significantly which could occur due potential misuse/abuse by malicious users worldwide everyday..  Lastly , make sure all new features are tested thoroughly before release to avoid introducing bugs into production environment impacting end-user experience negatively.
    In conclusion, each NFR should be closely tied with a functional requirement ensuring system meets necessary standards in terms of usability & performance while maintaining required security levels and offering scalability for future growth..  These requirements ensure the overall quality assurance across all aspects involved during development process resulting an efficient yet secure blogging platform!   Thank You.
