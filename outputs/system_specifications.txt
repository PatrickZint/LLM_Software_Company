## **4. System Design Recommendations**

System design recommendations provide guidance on the architectural and technological aspects necessary to fulfill the specified requirements effectively.

### **4.1 Architecture**

- **Modular Design:**
  - Structure the application into distinct modules:
    - **UI Module:** Handles all GUI elements and user interactions.
    - **Logic Module:** Manages the processing and evaluation of arithmetic expressions.
    - **Error Handling Module:** Deals with detecting and managing errors gracefully.
- **Separation of Concerns:**
  - Ensure that each module has a clear responsibility, enhancing maintainability and scalability.

### **4.2 Technology Stack**

- **Programming Language:** Python 3.10 or later for leveraging the latest features and security updates.
- **GUI Library:** Tkinter for creating the GUI, as it is bundled with Python and requires no additional installations.

### **4.3 Calculation Logic Implementation**

- **Expression Parsing:**
  - Utilize Python’s `eval()` function with caution, ensuring proper sanitization to avoid execution of unintended code.
  - Alternatively, implement a custom parser or use the `ast` module to safely evaluate expressions.
