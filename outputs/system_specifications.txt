Below is a detailed specification document that outlines functional requirements, non‐functional requirements, and system design recommendations for the 2D N-body simulation software. Each section is structured to address the refined goals and environmental constraints provided.

─────────────────────────────  
1. Functional Requirements  
─────────────────────────────

A. Simulation Engine  
 • The system shall simulate gravitational interactions between multiple celestial bodies (e.g., planets, asteroids) in a two-dimensional space.  
 • The engine will compute gravitational forces between bodies using physics-based equations (e.g., Newton’s law of universal gravitation: F = G · m₁ · m₂ / r²), updating velocities and positions accordingly.  
 • The simulation engine shall support time-driven calculations with a configurable time step size.  
 • The engine must support adjustable simulation speed vs. numerical accuracy trade-offs.

B. Celestial Body Management  
 • The system shall allow users to define an arbitrary number of celestial bodies at configuration time.  
 • Each celestial body must have configurable properties including:  
  – Unique identifier  
  – Mass (must be a positive floating-point value)  
  – Initial position (x, y coordinates within a defined realistic range)  
  – Initial velocity (vector in 2D)  
 • The simulation shall validate input values (e.g., mass > 0, positions within acceptable bounds).  
 • The system shall support dynamic addition or removal of celestial bodies prior to simulation start (via configuration reload) to accommodate different simulation scenarios.

C. Numerical Integration Methods  
 • The engine shall implement at least three numerical integration methods using a strategy pattern for selection:  
  – Euler integration (first-order method)  
  – Verlet integration (symplectic integration to improve energy conservation, preferred for long-term simulations)  
  – Runge-Kutta 4 (RK4) integration method for higher accuracy when needed  
 • Users must be able to select the integration method and configure numerical integration parameters (e.g., time step size) through configuration files or command-line parameters.  
 • The system should clearly document the trade-offs associated with time step size and integration method choices.

D. Configuration Management (Saving/Loading)  
 • The simulation shall support exporting the complete configuration to a JSON file that includes:  
  – Global simulation parameters (gravitational constant, default time step, selected numerical integration method)  
  – A list detailing each celestial body’s properties (unique ID, mass, initial position, velocity, etc.)  
 • The system shall support loading simulation settings from a JSON file.  
 • A versioned and well-documented JSON schema must be provided to ensure backward and forward compatibility.  
 • The configuration loader must perform robust input validation and provide descriptive error messages when configuration errors are detected.

E. User Interface and Visual Output  
 • The simulation front end (which may include a GUI or command-line based interface) shall display real-time simulation progress.  
 • The system shall provide options to pause, resume, and adjust non-critical simulation parameters at runtime (e.g., simulation speed).  
 • A simple 2D visual representation must be provided, either as a dynamic plot using Matplotlib or as logged output of the trajectories, to allow users to verify simulation behavior.

F. Traceability and Testing  
 • Each functional requirement must have corresponding test cases:  
  – Validate that numerical integration methods produce expected trajectories for known test scenarios.  
  – Verify proper handling of celestial body creation, validation, and dynamic configuration reloading.  
  – Confirm that exporting and reloading JSON configuration preserves simulation state accurately.  
 • Acceptance criteria will include reproducibility of simulation behavior when a saved configuration is reloaded and clear pass/fail conditions for integration accuracy, performance metrics, and input validation.

2. Non-Functional Requirements  
─────────────────────────────

A. Performance and Scalability  
 • The simulation software must maintain a response time (e.g., simulation update cycle) within defined limits (for interactive simulations, aim for an update within 500 milliseconds in 95% of cases).  
 • Benchmark tests shall be conducted to document behavior when scaling to large numbers of celestial bodies, with guidelines on memory and CPU usage.  
 • The system must provide performance profiling to identify bottlenecks, particularly when running extended simulations or high-resolution integrations.
 • Guidelines will be provided for recommended hardware configurations and maximum supported simulation sizes (e.g., handling up to several hundred bodies on modest hardware).

B. Security  
 • The system must adhere to secure coding practices (e.g., as prescribed by OWASP standards), ensuring that:  
  – Sensitive settings or configurations are stored with appropriate access control.  
  – Input (e.g., JSON configuration files) is sanitized and validated to mitigate injection attacks or data tampering.  
  – Any logging or audit trails do not expose sensitive data.
 • If the system exposes any networked components (e.g., a web-based UI), secure authentication and authorization mechanisms must be implemented.
 • Configuration files and data in transit should, if applicable, be encrypted using well-vetted cryptographic libraries.

C. Technology Stack Constraints  
 • The software is to be developed in Python (version 3.8 or above) ensuring compatibility with modern language features.  
 • Numerical operations shall be implemented using NumPy, ensuring correct handling of large arrays and optimized performance.  
 • For visualizations and plotting, the system shall use Matplotlib with consideration given to rendering performance and interactivity.  
 • Dependency and version management will be handled using virtual environment tools (virtualenv, conda) or Docker containers to ensure reproducibility.

D. Reliability and Maintainability  
 • The system shall be modular, with clear separation between simulation logic, configuration management, and the user interface.  
 • All code shall be accompanied by unit tests, integration tests, and performance tests, facilitating automated testing and future refactoring.  
 • Documentation (in-code and external) must detail assumptions, performance constraints, and security practices to support maintenance and future contributions.
 • The platform must be easy to extend (e.g., for adding collision detection, relativistic corrections), which will be achieved by following a modular architecture and design patterns.

3. System Design Recommendations  
─────────────────────────────

A. Architectural Overview  
 • Employ a layered architecture to isolate concerns:
  1. Simulation Core Layer:  
   – Contains the physics engine and numerical integration implementations.  
   – Uses a strategy pattern to allow easy swapping between Euler, Verlet, and RK4 integrators.
  2. Configuration Manager:  
   – Handles JSON schema validation, loading, and saving of simulation settings.  
   – Ensures backward and forward compatibility via versioned JSON schemas.
  3. User Interface Layer:  
   – Provides either a GUI (possibly using a lightweight UI toolkit) or a command-line interface.  
   – Responsible for rendering simulation state (via Matplotlib) and interacting with the user for actions such as pausing/resuming.
  4. Testing and Validation Module:  
   – Includes unit tests, integration tests, and performance benchmarks.
   – Manages automated testing using frameworks like pytest.

B. Design Patterns and Modularity  
 • Integration Method Strategy: Define a common interface for integration methods so that new numerical algorithms can be added as plug-ins.  
 • MVC or MVVM Pattern: If a GUI is implemented, use these patterns to separate domain logic from presentation.  
 • Dependency Injection: Facilitate testing by injecting simulation parameters and mocking external dependencies (e.g., file system interactions for configuration loading).

C. Data Flow and Module Interaction  
 • The simulation begins with configuration loading. The Configuration Manager component reads a JSON file, validates its structure against the JSON schema, and instantiates celestial body objects along with global parameters.  
 • The Simulation Core reads these parameters and selects the appropriate numerical integration strategy.  
 • During simulation runtime, the core computation updates body states, while the UI layer periodically requests state snapshots to display trajectories.  
 • Logging and error handling components capture any validation errors, simulation exceptions, or performance warnings.

D. Environment and Dependency Management  
 • Specify a requirements.txt (or equivalent) containing specific versions of Python packages (e.g., NumPy, Matplotlib) to ensure consistency across environments.  
 • Consider employing Docker for containerized deployment, encapsulating all dependencies and environment specifics.
 • Document performance benchmarks and recommended hardware requirements in the user and deployment manuals.

E. Testing and Continuous Integration  
 • Implement unit tests for:  
  – Individual physics calculations and integration method outputs.  
  – Input validation logic for celestial body parameters and the configuration loader.  
 • Develop integration tests that simulate known scenarios and compare output trajectories against expected results.  
 • Set up continuous integration (CI) pipelines to run tests automatically on code commits, ensuring that core functionality, security verifications, and performance benchmarks are consistently met.
