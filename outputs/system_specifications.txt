Below is a detailed set of system specifications for the N-body simulation software that addresses the refined goals and environment profile. The specifications are organized into three main sections: Functional Requirements, Nonfunctional Requirements, and System Design Recommendations.

─────────────────────────────  
1. SYSTEM OVERVIEW

The N-body simulation software is intended to simulate gravitational interactions between celestial bodies (planets) in a 2D space, based on Newtonian physics. The simulation engine will calculate gravitational forces, update positions and velocities over discrete time steps, and produce both a real‐time visualization and detailed output logs. Users will be able to configure simulation parameters (including integration methods, time step, gravitational constant, and initial conditions) via a configuration file or through an interactive GUI developed using Python and pygame.

2. FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

A. Simulation Engine

 1. Physics Calculation  
  • RF-1.1: The engine shall compute gravitational forces between every pair of bodies using Newton’s gravitational formula: F = G * m1 * m2 / r².  
  • RF-1.2: The engine shall update the velocity and position of each celestial body at every simulation time step based on the computed forces.  
  • RF-1.3: The engine shall support customizable integration methods. At a minimum, the simulation must support Euler’s method, Verlet integration, and Runge–Kutta, with the ability to select or configure the integration method at startup.

 2. Configurable Simulation Parameters  
  • RF-1.4: Users shall be able to define initial conditions for each celestial body (position, velocity, mass) through a configuration file (e.g., JSON, CSV) or interactive GUI input.  
  • RF-1.5: The simulation shall provide user-configurable parameters including the time step duration and gravitational constant (G).  
  • RF-1.6: A parameters validation routine must verify that values provided are physically reasonable (e.g., nonnegative mass, positive time step).

B. Output and Logging

 1. Simulation Data Output  
  • RF-2.1: At every simulation time step, the system shall generate an output containing:  
   – The computed gravitational forces for each interacting pair of bodies.  
   – Updated positions and velocities for each celestial body.  
  • RF-2.2: Each log entry shall be timestamped based on simulation time steps and stored in a structured format (e.g., CSV or JSON) that allows for easy post-simulation analysis.
  • RF-2.3: The output data shall be optionally displayed in the GUI via a dedicated side-panel or log window, with filtering options to adjust verbosity.

C. Graphical User Interface (GUI) and Visualization

 1. Visualization  
  • RF-3.1: A dedicated 2D visualization window shall display the simulation state in real time.  
  • RF-3.2: Each celestial body shall be rendered using visual markers that reflect properties such as mass (e.g., size scaling) and optionally a distinct color or shape.  
  • RF-3.3: The visualization display must automatically update at each simulation time step to reflect current positions and velocities.

 2. User Controls  
  • RF-3.4: The GUI shall include controls to start, pause, resume, and stop the simulation.
  • RF-3.5: The system shall support interactive control features including zooming, panning, and (optionally) stepping through individual simulation frames for detailed analysis.
  • RF-3.6: Tooltips and in-application documentation shall assist users in understanding control functions and simulation parameters.

D. Dynamic Handling of Celestial Bodies

 1. Runtime Modifications  
  • RF-4.1: The system shall support the addition of new celestial bodies during runtime, ensuring that the simulation calculations incorporate new bodies immediately.
  • RF-4.2: The system shall allow for the removal or modification of existing bodies during runtime without destabilizing the simulation.
  • RF-4.3: The simulation must remain efficient and stable when dealing with an arbitrary number of bodies, applying optimization strategies if required.

3. NONFUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

A. Performance  
 • RNF-1.1: The simulation must maintain a minimum frame rate of 30 FPS at a resolution of 800×600 under typical loads (e.g., 10–50 bodies) on hardware with at least a dual-core processor and 4GB of RAM.  
 • RNF-1.2: Key computational routines (e.g., force calculations) must be profiled to ensure that processing times per frame meet real-time requirements.  
 • RNF-1.3: Input responsiveness (e.g., handling control commands) must exhibit a latency below 100 ms.  
 • RNF-1.4: The code shall be modular and optimized, with designated points for using performance profiling tools (e.g., cProfile in Python) to identify and resolve bottlenecks.

B. Usability  
 • RNF-2.1: The GUI design must follow usability best practices, featuring an intuitive layout with clear visual cues, feedback, and control elements.  
 • RNF-2.2: Comprehensive documentation within the application (e.g., tooltips, a help menu) must explain simulation parameters, input formats, and control functionalities.  
 • RNF-2.3: Error messages and prompts should be user-friendly, providing guidance for correcting configuration or runtime issues.

C. Extensibility and Maintainability  
 • RNF-3.1: The system architecture shall be modular, separating the physics engine, visualization, and data logging into distinct components that can be developed, tested, and maintained independently.  
 • RNF-3.2: A suite of unit tests and integration tests must be implemented for the simulation logic, ensuring correctness and stability during future modifications.  
 • RNF-3.3: The codebase shall follow coding standards and include inline documentation and high-level architecture documentation to facilitate future extensions or technology stack updates (e.g., refactoring integration methods or optimizing performance-critical routines).

4. SYSTEM DESIGN RECOMMENDATIONS

A. Architectural Approach  
 • Use a modular architecture that separates core concerns:
  – Physics Engine Module: Handles force calculations, state updates, and supports multiple integration methods.
  – Configuration Module: Loads and validates input configurations (from files and GUI).
  – Visualization Module (GUI): Built with pygame manages rendering, interactive controls, and user feedback.
  – Logging Module: Responsible for writing simulation state outputs (timestamped in CSV/JSON) for later review.
 • Consider a Model-View-Controller (MVC) or similar pattern where:
  – The “Model” represents the simulation data and physics.
  – The “View” is responsible for real-time visualization.
  – The “Controller” manages user input and runtime operations (start, pause, add/remove bodies).

B. Integration Method Selection  
 • Abstract the integration method in the simulation engine so that switching from Euler to Verlet or Runge–Kutta can be achieved without significant code rework.  
 • Use a plug-in or strategy pattern to encapsulate integration calculations. This allows for:
  – Easy extension to additional methods in the future.
  – Runtime selection based on configuration or user input.

C. Data Management and Logging  
 • Define a robust data schema for logging output data that captures:
  – Simulation time step.
  – Positions and velocities of each body.
  – Computed forces between pairs of bodies.
 • Provide both file-based logging and in-memory logging with GUI display options.  
 • Ensure that logging does not degrade performance (e.g., perform asynchronous file writes if necessary).

D. Runtime Modification of Simulation State  
 • Implement an event-handling system within the simulation engine that listens for user events/instructions (add, remove, modify bodies) and updates the internal state safely.
 • Ensure thread safety if the GUI event loop and simulation calculations run concurrently.  
 • Validate changes in simulation state to prevent numerical instability.

E. GUI Development Using Python and pygame  
 • Standardize on Python 3.8+ and pygame 2.0+ to avoid compatibility issues.  
 • Design the GUI layout to include:
  – A main simulation window for 2D rendering.
  – A control panel with start/pause/resume/stop buttons.
  – An optional sidebar or pop-up window for detailed logs and simulation parameters.
  – Interactive features such as zooming and panning via mouse input targeting intuitive controls.
 • Consider the use of double-buffering and optimizing redraw regions to maintain the required 30 FPS performance.

F. Performance Monitoring and Optimization  
 • Integrate profiling tools (e.g., cProfile) into the development process to regularly monitor performance, especially targeting the physics engine’s numerical routines.  
 • Optimize data structures – for example, consider using spatial partitioning techniques (quad-trees) if the number of bodies increases, to minimize the computational cost of force calculations.  
 • Plan for potential use of native extensions or leveraging libraries like Cython should performance bottlenecks be identified.
