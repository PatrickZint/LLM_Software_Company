Below is a detailed system specification document for the 3D gravitational simulation project. This document includes functional requirements, non‐functional requirements, and system design recommendations that comprehensively capture all of the refined goals and environment constraints.

────────────────────────────
1. OVERVIEW

Project Description:  
Develop an interactive software system to simulate gravitational interactions among celestial bodies in a three-dimensional environment. The system models orbital dynamics accurately, supports configurable collision handling (e.g., merge or bounce modes), provides real-time 3D visualization with interactive controls, and includes comprehensive data export capabilities. The application is to be implemented in Python (v3.8+), leveraging Numpy for numerical processing, VPython for visualization, and HDF5 (via h5py) for data storage, along with industry-standard security measures.

2. FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

A. Simulation Engine & Physics Modeling

• Core Physics Model:
  – Implement a Newtonian gravitational model (with future support for relativistic corrections if required).
  – Each celestial body record will include properties such as mass, radius, position, and velocity.
  – Time integration should be explicit, specifying one of the following methods:
     • Runge-Kutta (e.g., RK4)

      • Pan, zoom, and rotation
      • Playback controls, including start, pause, step-through, restart, and speed adjustment
  – Enable selection of individual celestial bodies to display properties (current velocity, mass, etc.) along with the ability to display trajectory trails.

• Visual Differentiation:
  – Employ visual markers such as colors, sizes, and optional trails to distinguish different bodies.
  – Optionally, include visual aids (e.g., axes, grid) to help orientation within the 3D space.

3. NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

A. Performance & Scalability

• Simulation Performance:
  – Ensure real-time performance of the visualization module even with a realistic number of bodies (target: 50–100 bodies).
  – Optimize critical routines using Numpy, and if necessary, employ multi-threading or multiprocessing (with attention to Python’s GIL).
  – Document and adhere to benchmarks:
      • Operations (e.g., gravitational calculations) should complete within defined milliseconds.
      • Memory usage should be controlled (e.g., X MB per process).
  
• Collision Detection Scalability:
  – Utilize spatial partitioning (quad/octrees or BVHs) to ensure performance scales with larger numbers of bodies.
    
B. Usability

• User Interface:
  – Provide an intuitive GUI and/or configuration file interface for:
      • Simulation parameter entry (bodies, positions, velocities, masses)
      • Collision handling mode and parameters
      • Data export options
  – Onscreen help and tooltips should explain key features and functionalities.
  
• Documentation:
  – Supply clear user documentation covering installation, usage, and troubleshooting.
  – Include developer documentation to facilitate future extensions (e.g., plugin development).

C. Reliability & Accuracy

• Numerical Accuracy:
  – Provide configuration options to balance computational speed with accuracy (e.g., integration tolerances).
  – Incorporate robust error handling to flag potential instabilities or invalid input values.

• Logging & Error Management:
  – Log simulation events and errors with sufficient detail for debugging.
  – Ensure simulation state consistency and graceful recovery from runtime exceptions.

D. Extensibility

• Modular Design:
  – Architect the system to support future extensions such as:
      • Additional physics models (e.g., alternative gravitational theories or additional forces)
      • New collision resolution methods
  – Support plugin frameworks or external configuration files to register and load new modules without codebase modification.

4. ENVIRONMENT AND SECURITY REQUIREMENTS

A. Security

• Authentication & Authorization:
  – If remote access or multi-user support is implemented, adhere to OWASP guidelines for managing user credentials and session security.
  
• Data Security:
  – Encrypt sensitive data in transit and at rest (e.g., secure HDF5 file access, use TLS for network interactions).
  – Use environment variables and secure key management practices for configuration containing sensitive information.
  
• Security Best Practices:
  – Conduct regular automated vulnerability scans and code reviews.
  – Manage dependencies with controlled environments (virtualenv, Docker) to reduce potential vulnerabilities.

B. Performance Targets (Additional Quantified Requirements)

• The simulation core should process gravitational computations within a target threshold (e.g., each tick processed within N milliseconds).
• Visual interactions (camera movements, playback commands) should have a response latency of no more than 150–250 milliseconds.
• Memory consumption during heavy load should be profiled and maintained below specific thresholds (examples documented in performance benchmarks).

C. Technology Stack Specifications

• Python – Version 3.8 or higher.
• Numpy – Version 1.21 or higher, for optimized numerical computations.
• VPython – Ensure the version is tested for compatibility with target hardware to maintain real-time rendering.
• HDF5 – Use h5py for interfacing with HDF5 files, with strategies defined for file indexing and chunking to optimize large dataset handling.
• Dependency Management – Prefer virtual environments (e.g., virtualenv, pipenv) or containerization (Docker) to ensure consistent deployments.

5. SYSTEM DESIGN RECOMMENDATIONS

A. Architectural Design

• Modular Separation:
  – Separate the simulation engine from the visualization subsystem.
  – Decouple physics calculations (simulation loop) from I/O (data logging, export). Consider using an asynchronous queue system for logging events to avoid slowing down the simulation loop.

• Layered Architecture:
  – Core Simulation Layer: Implements physics, integration methods, and collision detection/resolution.
  – Services Layer: Handles data export, logging, and security (encryption, secure file I/O).
  – Presentation Layer: Provides interactive 3D visualization and user interface controls.

• Event-Driven Architecture:
  – Consider an event-driven model for handling user interactions (e.g., playback commands, adjusting simulation parameters) and simulation events (collision detections).

B. Algorithmic Considerations

• Numerical Solver Optimization:
  – Profile the integration methods (e.g., Runge-Kutta, Verlet) and choose adaptive time stepping if necessary.
  
• Collision Detection:
  – Integrate spatial partitioning techniques:
      • Use octrees or uniform grids for 3D space partitioning to reduce the number of pairwise collision checks.
  – Provide fallbacks to brute-force detection when the number of bodies is low.

C. Visualization Design

• Use VPython’s capabilities to maintain high rendering performance:
  – Leverage hardware acceleration if available.
  – Implement level-of-detail adjustments for distant objects or periods of high computational load.
  
• UI/Interaction Flow:
  – Design a main dashboard with distinct panels for simulation view, simulation control (playback, speed adjustment), and parameter configuration.
  – Consider a modular UI design should the application need to scale to more complex simulation controls in the future.

D. Integration and Testing

• Automated Testing:
  – Develop test cases for individual components:
      • Physics unit tests (verifying gravitational force and collision responses)
      • Integration tests (ensuring simulation parameters are applied correctly)
      • UI tests (validating user interaction responses)
      • Performance tests (benchmarking processing speed and resource consumption)
  
• Code Review & Security Audits:
  – Integrate automated vulnerability scanning tools.
  – Establish a process for security audits and performance profiling before each major release.

• Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):
  – Set up CI/CD pipelines using containerized environments to ensure consistent dependency management and cross-platform compatibility.
