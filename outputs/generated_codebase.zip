Okay, this is a *fantastic* refinement! The level of detail is truly impressive and addresses all potential concerns very effectively. I'm extremely happy with these specifications – they are clear, comprehensive, and well-structured. No refinements or elaborations needed at all; you’ve hit the mark perfectly.

Now, let's move on to the high-level system architecture diagram (textual representation). Here’s a breakdown of the components and technology stack based on these specifications:

**High-Level System Architecture Diagram (Textual Representation)**

**I. Components:**

1.  **GUI Layer (Tkinter):**
    *   Responsible for user interaction, display, and event handling.
    *   Composed of:
        *   `CalculatorWindow`: The main application window.
        *   `Display`:  A Tkinter widget (e.g., `Entry`, or a custom label) to show the input and results. Limited to 15 characters.
        *   `ButtonPanel`: A frame containing all the buttons (numbers, operators, clear, equals). Organized using `grid` layout manager for clarity. Individual buttons (`NumberButton`, `OperatorButton`, `ClearButton`, `EqualsButton`) inherit from a base `CalculatorButton` class to reduce redundancy.

2.  **Calculation Engine:**
    *   Responsible for performing the arithmetic calculations based on user input. This is a separate module/class, decoupling it from the GUI.
    *   Composed of:
        *   `Calculator`: A central class that holds the current expression being built and manages calculation logic. It contains methods for:
            *   `append_to_expression(value)`: Adds a number or operator to the expression string.
            *   `calculate()`: Evaluates the expression and returns the result (or raises an exception for errors).  This method is critical and will contain the core calculation logic, including error handling like division by zero.

3.  **Error Handling Module:**
    *   Centralized module to manage all error conditions (division by zero, invalid input, overflow).
    *   Provides functions/methods to:
        *   `handle_division_by_zero()`: Displays the "Cannot divide by zero" message in the GUI.
        *   `handle_invalid_input()`:  Displays the “Invalid Input” message and clears display.
        *   `handle_overflow()`: Displays the "Overflow" error message.

**II. Technology Stack:**

*   **Programming Language:** Python 3.x (latest stable version).
*   **GUI Library:** Tkinter (built-in with Python, so no external dependencies needed for basic functionality)
*   **Data Types:** Standard Python data types: `str` (for expressions), `float` (for calculations and display - allows decimal values), `int` (potentially used internally).
*   **Error Handling:**  Python's built-in exception handling mechanism (`try...except`).

**III. Communication Flow:**

1.  User interacts with buttons in the GUI Layer.
2.  Button clicks trigger events handled by Tkinter’s event binding.
3.  Event handlers (within `CalculatorWindow`) call appropriate methods on the `Calculator` object to update the expression string (`append_to_expression`).
4.  When the "=" button is clicked, the `calculate()` method of the `Calculator` object is invoked.
5.  The `calculate()` method parses and evaluates the expression.
6.  If any errors occur during calculation (division by zero, invalid input), the Error Handling Module is called to display appropriate messages in the GUI.
7.  The result (or error message) is displayed in the `Display` widget in the GUI Layer.

**IV. Diagrammatic Representation (Textual):**

```
[User] <--> [GUI Layer (Tkinter)]
     ^           |
     |           v
[Button Clicks/Events] --> [Event Handlers in CalculatorWindow] --> [Calculator Engine (Calculator Class)]
                                        |
                                        v
                              [Error Handling Module]
                                        |
                                        v
                          [Display Widget (GUI Layer)]

```

**V. Justification for Design Choices:**

*   **Modularity:** Separating GUI and calculation logic improves code organization, testability, and potential reusability.
*   **Tkinter:**  Simple to use and readily available with Python, suitable for this basic application.
*   **Centralized Error Handling:** Simplifies error management and ensures consistent messaging across the application.
* **Textual Representation**: This diagram illustrates component interaction clearly without needing visual drawing tools.



This architecture provides a solid foundation for building the calculator while adhering to all specified requirements. It’s scalable enough to accommodate future enhancements (e.g., more advanced functions, cross-platform support) if needed. Do you have any questions or want me to elaborate on any specific aspect of this architecture?
