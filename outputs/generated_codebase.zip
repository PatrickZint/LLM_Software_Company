Okay, thank you again for the incredibly insightful feedback!  I've carefully considered all your points and incorporated them into further refined versions of both documents. I’m aiming to make these as practical and unambiguous as possible for a development team.

Here's the fully revised documentation, incorporating your suggestions with changes highlighted in **bold**.  Following this, I'll provide a summary of reasoning behind the changes and address any remaining points. After that, *I am ready to generate the full codebase if you would like me to*.

## Calculator System Specifications (Revised - v2)

**1. Understanding:** As before.

**2. Refined Requirements:**

*   **FR1: Input Handling – User Interaction & Operator Format:**
    *   Users will interact with the calculator through a graphical user interface (GUI).
    *   Operators (+, -, *, /) will be provided via **dedicated buttons on the GUI**. Direct text input of operators is *not* supported in this initial release. This simplifies UI design and reduces potential security vulnerabilities.
    *   Numbers will be entered either by clicking numeric buttons or directly typing into an input field. The input field will only accept numerical characters (0-9) and a decimal point. **The GUI will provide immediate visual feedback when invalid characters are entered, preventing them from being added to the expression.**
*   **FR2: Calculation Logic – Order of Operations:**
    *   Calculations will follow the standard order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS). **For this initial release, calculations will be performed strictly from left to right. This limitation is clearly documented in the user manual and displayed prominently during calculation.** Future releases *should* incorporate full PEMDAS/BODMAS support ("Should Have" priority – see prioritization section below).
*   **FR3: Error Handling – Overflow/Underflow & Precision:**
    *   The calculator utilizes Python's floating-point arithmetic. **While Python’s float type has a large range, the display will switch to scientific notation when results exceed +/- 1e+15 or are smaller than +/- 1e-15.** An error message "Result exceeds display limits" will be displayed in these cases.
    *   **The calculator will display numbers with a maximum of 10 decimal places.** This limit is imposed to prevent excessive precision and improve readability. **If the result has fewer than 10 significant digits, it will be rounded appropriately for display (e.g., 3.1415926 -> 3.14159).**
    *   **The calculator should handle division by zero gracefully, displaying an error message "Division by zero" without crashing the application.**
*   **FR4: Display - Formatting:**
    *   Numbers on the display will be formatted as follows:
        *   **Maximum width of 20 characters.**
        *   **No thousands separators (commas) for numbers less than 1,000.**
        *   **Thousands separators will be used for numbers greater than or equal to 1,000 (e.g., 1,000,000).**
        *   **The decimal point character will be '.' (period).  If the number is an integer, no decimal point will be displayed.**

**3. Prioritization (MoSCoW):**

*   **Must Have:** FR1, FR2, FR3, FR4 – *Core functionality is essential for the calculator to operate.*
*   **Should Have:**  Full PEMDAS/BODMAS implementation (future release) – *Important but not critical for initial launch.*
*   **Could Have:** Support for more advanced functions (square root, exponents, trigonometric functions) - *Desirable but can be deferred.*
*   **Won't Have:** Direct text input of operators.  – *Not planned for this release.*

**4. Challenges:**
    *   Implementing PEMDAS/BODMAS requires careful consideration to avoid precedence errors.
    *   Maintaining readability while adhering to display formatting constraints can be tricky, especially with large numbers in scientific notation.
    *   **Ensuring consistent behavior across different browsers and operating systems when rendering the GUI.**

**5. Next Steps:**
    *   Finalize GUI design and implement input validation logic.
    *   Implement the core calculation engine (left-to-right evaluation).
    *   Thoroughly test error handling scenarios (overflow, underflow, division by zero).

## Environment Profile (Revised - v2)

**1. Understanding:** As before.

**2. Refined Profile:**

*   **Deployment Environment:** **The calculator will be deployed as a web application using Flask (Python framework). It will run on an Apache web server behind a load balancer.** This decision enables accessibility from various devices and simplifies maintenance. The frontend will be built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
*   **Scalability:**  **The system should be horizontally scalable to handle up to 100 concurrent users with an average response time of less than 200 milliseconds for simple calculations (e.g., addition, subtraction). Response times for more complex calculations (involving multiple operations) should not exceed 500 milliseconds.** This requires a robust database and efficient caching mechanisms.  **We anticipate needing at least two Apache web servers behind the load balancer to achieve this target during peak usage.**
*   **Data Storage:** **The calculator does not require persistent storage of calculation history. All data is transient and processed in memory.** Therefore, a database is *not* required for this initial release.
*   **Security:**
    *   **Authentication/Authorization:**  **No user authentication or authorization will be implemented initially. The application will be publicly accessible.** (This should be revisited as a future security enhancement).
    *   **Input Validation:** All input must be rigorously validated to prevent injection attacks and ensure data integrity. **The GUI framework will provide built-in validation features, which *must* be utilized extensively.  Specifically, all user inputs should be sanitized using appropriate escaping techniques.**
    *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** **Automated vulnerability scanning will be performed weekly using OWASP ZAP.**
    *   **Secure Coding Practices:**  Developers *must* adhere to secure coding guidelines (e.g., avoid using `eval()` or other potentially unsafe functions).
*   **Compliance Requirements:** **This calculator application is not subject to any specific regulatory compliance requirements at this time.**

**3. Challenges:**
    *   Ensuring horizontal scalability will require careful optimization of the Flask application and efficient caching strategies.
    *   **Maintaining consistent styling across different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).**
    *   **Monitoring server health and performance to proactively identify potential bottlenecks or issues.**

**4. Next Steps:**
    *   Set up the development environment with Flask, Apache, and necessary dependencies.
    *   Develop the basic HTML/CSS structure for the GUI.
    *   Implement input validation routines in the JavaScript frontend.
