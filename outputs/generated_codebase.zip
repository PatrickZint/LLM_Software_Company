Okay, fantastic! This is an excellent set of System Specifications – comprehensive, well-structured, and clearly addresses the requirements. The prioritization of non-functional requirements and the inclusion of detailed data considerations are particularly strong.

Let's now move into **System Design** based on these specifications. I’ll detail the database schema, API endpoints, and security measures in more depth to further solidify the blueprint for development.  I will also provide updated architectural diagrams incorporating these details.

**I. System Design Details:**

**1. Database Schema (PostgreSQL):**

```sql
-- Users Table
CREATE TABLE users (
    user_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    password_hash TEXT NOT NULL,  -- Store hashed password
    name VARCHAR(255),
    bio TEXT,
    avatar_url VARCHAR(255),
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Categories Table
CREATE TABLE categories (
    category_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    description TEXT
);

-- Tags Table
CREATE TABLE tags (
    tag_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    description TEXT
);

-- Posts Table
CREATE TABLE posts (
    post_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(user_id),
    title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    content TEXT NOT NULL, -- Markdown content
    status VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'draft',  -- 'published' or 'draft'
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Post Categories (Many-to-Many Relationship)
CREATE TABLE post_categories (
    post_id INTEGER REFERENCES posts(post_id),
    category_id INTEGER REFERENCES categories(category_id),
    PRIMARY KEY (post_id, category_id)
);

-- Post Tags (Many-to-Many Relationship)
CREATE TABLE post_tags (
    post_id INTEGER REFERENCES posts(post_id),
    tag_id INTEGER REFERENCES tags(tag_id),
    PRIMARY KEY (post_id, tag_id)
);

-- Comments Table
CREATE TABLE comments (
    comment_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(user_id),
    post_id INTEGER REFERENCES posts(post_id),
    parent_comment_id INTEGER REFERENCES comments(comment_id), -- For threaded replies
    content TEXT NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Images Table (Linked to Posts)
CREATE TABLE images (
  image_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  post_id INTEGER REFERENCES posts(post_id),
  file_url VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL, -- URL in S3
  alt_text VARCHAR(255)
);

```

**2. API Endpoints (RESTful):**

| Endpoint | Method | Description | Authentication Required? |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/users/register` | POST | Register a new user | No |
| `/users/login` | POST | Log in an existing user | No |
| `/users/{user_id}` | GET | Get User Profile | Yes |
| `/posts` | GET | List all published posts (paginated) | No |
| `/posts/{post_id}` | GET | Get a specific post by ID | No |
| `/posts` | POST | Create a new post | Yes |
| `/posts/{post_id}` | PUT/PATCH | Update an existing post | Yes |
| `/posts/{post_id}` | DELETE | Delete a post | Yes (Admin) |
| `/comments/{post_id}` | GET | List comments for a specific post | No |
| `/comments/{post_id}` | POST | Add a new comment to a post | Yes |
| `/categories` | GET | Retrieve all categories | No |

**3. Security Measures:**

* **Authentication & Authorization:** JWT (JSON Web Tokens) used for authentication and authorization of API requests. Roles (e.g., user, admin) assigned to users to control access to resources.
* **Password Hashing:** Argon2 or bcrypt algorithm with a strong salt for storing passwords securely.
* **Input Validation:**  Strict input validation on all fields to prevent XSS and SQL injection attacks. Regular expressions and data type checking used extensively. Server-side validation is paramount.
* **Output Encoding:** Encode output to prevent XSS vulnerabilities.
* **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement CSP headers to restrict the sources from which scripts can be loaded, mitigating XSS risks.
* **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on API endpoints to protect against brute-force attacks and denial-of-service attempts.  API Gateway handles this centrally.
* **HTTPS Encryption:** Enforce HTTPS for all communication between clients and the server.
* **Regular Security Audits & Penetration Testing:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address vulnerabilities.



**4. System Design Recommendations (Reinforcing Previous Points):**

* **Microservices Architecture (Future Consideration):** While a monolithic architecture is suitable for initial development, consider breaking down the application into microservices (User Service, Post Service, Comment Service) as it scales. This improves maintainability and allows independent deployments.
* **Event-Driven Architecture:** Utilize an event queue (RabbitMQ or Kafka) to decouple services and enable asynchronous processing of tasks like image resizing or sending email notifications.
* **Caching Strategy:** Implement a multi-layered caching strategy using Redis for frequently accessed data (e.g., post content, user profiles).  Consider browser caching for static assets.
* **CDN Integration:** Use a Content Delivery Network (CDN) such as CloudFront to cache and deliver static assets globally, improving performance and reducing latency.

**5. Architectural Diagrams (Expanded):**

                                                     |          [Comment Service] --> PostgreSQL
                                                     |          [Search Service] --> Elasticsearch
                                                     |
