Okay, great! Let's focus first on **Database Schema Design** and then we'll move onto the **Authentication Flow with JWT**. I'm aiming for a schema that is reasonably normalized to avoid redundancy while also considering performance needs (especially around search).

Here's my proposal:

**Database Schema:**

We’ll use PostgreSQL as our database.

*   **`users` Table:**
    *   `user_id` (`SERIAL PRIMARY KEY`) - Unique identifier for the user.
    *   `username` (`VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL`) - User's login username.  Must be unique.
    *   `email` (`VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL`) - User's email address. Must be unique.
    *   `password` (`VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL`) - Hashed password using a strong hashing algorithm like bcrypt.
    *   `first_name` (`VARCHAR(100)`)
    *   `last_name` (`VARCHAR(100)`)
    *   `address` (`TEXT`)
    *   `role` (`ENUM('customer', 'administrator') DEFAULT 'customer' NOT NULL`) - User role.  Restricts access to certain functionalities.
    *   `created_at` (`TIMESTAMP WITHOUT TIME ZONE DEFAULT (NOW() AT TIME ZONE 'utc')`) - Timestamp of account creation.
    *   `updated_at` (`TIMESTAMP WITHOUT TIME ZONE DEFAULT (NOW() AT TIME ZONE 'utc')`) - Timestamp of last update.

*   **`books` Table:**
    *   `book_id` (`SERIAL PRIMARY KEY`) - Unique identifier for the book.
    *   `isbn` (`VARCHAR(20) UNIQUE NOT NULL`) - International Standard Book Number (unique).
    *   `title` (`VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL`)
    *   `author` (`VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL`)  Consider a separate `authors` table for better normalization if we expect multiple authors per book.  For simplicity, keeping it as one field here.
    *   `genre` (`VARCHAR(100)`)
    *   `price` (`DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL`) - Price of the book (e.g., 19.99).
    *   `description` (`TEXT`) - Book description.
    *   `stock_quantity` (`INTEGER DEFAULT 0 NOT NULL`) - Number of copies currently in stock.  Crucial for inventory management.
    *   `image_url` (`VARCHAR(255)`) - URL to the book cover image.
    *   `created_at` (`TIMESTAMP WITHOUT TIME ZONE DEFAULT (NOW() AT TIME ZONE 'utc')`)
    *   `updated_at` (`TIMESTAMP WITHOUT TIME ZONE DEFAULT (NOW() AT TIME ZONE 'utc')`)

*   **`orders` Table:**
    *   `order_id` (`SERIAL PRIMARY KEY`) - Unique identifier for the order.
    *   `user_id` (`INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES users(user_id) ON DELETE CASCADE`) - Foreign key referencing the user who placed the order. `ON DELETE CASCADE` ensures that if a user is deleted, their orders are also removed.
    *   `order_date` (`TIMESTAMP WITHOUT TIME ZONE DEFAULT (NOW() AT TIME ZONE 'utc')`) - Date and time when the order was placed.
    *   `total_amount` (`DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL`) - Total amount of the order.
    *   `status` (`VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'pending'`) - Order status (e.g., pending, processing, shipped, delivered, cancelled).
    *   `payment_id` (`VARCHAR(255)`) – Stripe Payment ID for payment tracking and reconciliation.

*   **`order_items` Table:**  This is a junction table to handle the many-to-many relationship between orders and books.
    *   `order_item_id` (`SERIAL PRIMARY KEY`)
    *   `order_id` (`INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES orders(order_id) ON DELETE CASCADE`) - Foreign key referencing the order.
    *   `book_id` (`INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES books(book_id) ON DELETE CASCADE`) - Foreign key referencing the book ordered.
    *   `quantity` (`INTEGER NOT NULL`) - Quantity of the book in this particular order item.
    *   `price` (`DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL`) - Price of the book at the time of ordering (important for historical pricing).

**Indexes:**

*   On `users`: Index on `username`, `email`.
*   On `books`:  Index on `isbn`, `author`, `genre` (composite index may be more efficient for filtering by author and genre together).
*   On `orders`: Index on `user_id`, `order_date`.
*   On `order_items`: Indexes on `order_id`, `book_id`.

**Rationale:**

*   **Normalization:**  The schema is reasonably normalized to reduce redundancy. While keeping author in the `books` table simplifies things initially, a separate `authors` table with a linking table would allow for more complex relationships (e.g., multiple authors per book).
*   **Foreign Keys & ON DELETE CASCADE:** Foreign keys establish relationships between tables and ensure data integrity.  `ON DELETE CASCADE` propagates deletions appropriately.
*   **Data Types:** Appropriate data types are used for each column to optimize storage and performance.
*   **Timestamps:** `created_at` and `updated_at` timestamps provide valuable audit trail information.
*   **Indexes:** Indexes are crucial for query performance, especially for common search criteria (author, genre).  The specific indexes should be evaluated and adjusted based on actual usage patterns.



Now, let's move on to the **Authentication Flow with JWT**. Please review this schema and give me feedback before I proceed with detailing the authentication flow.
