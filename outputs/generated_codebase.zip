**2. Prioritized Non-Functional Requirements:**

| Requirement | Priority | Target | Testing Strategy |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Security (Authentication & Authorization)** | High | No unauthorized access; pass OWASP top 10 tests.  | Penetration testing, code reviews, security scans (SAST/DAST), regular vulnerability assessments. |
| **Performance – Search Response Time** | High | < 200ms for common search queries. | Load testing with realistic data volume, performance monitoring of Elasticsearch cluster and caching layer (Redis).  Simulated user searches during load tests. |
| **Scalability - User Capacity** | High | Support up to 1 million active users without significant performance degradation. | Scalability testing by gradually increasing user load using AWS autoscaling groups. Monitor database connections, CPU utilization, and memory usage across all services. |
| **Availability** | High | 99.9% uptime. | Continuous monitoring with CloudWatch, automated failover mechanisms in place for critical components (e.g., RDS Multi-AZ deployments), regular backups and disaster recovery drills.  Automated health checks. |
| **Performance – Image Processing Time** | Medium | < 1 second for image resizing/optimization on upload. | Load testing with high volumes of image uploads; monitor Lambda function execution time and queue lengths in SQS if implemented. |
| **Maintainability & Code Quality** | Medium | Adherence to coding standards, comprehensive test coverage (80% or higher).  | Static code analysis using tools like pylint, automated unit and integration tests with pytest, regular code reviews following established guidelines. |
| **Usability** | Medium | High user satisfaction based on usability testing. | User interviews, A/B testing of UI elements, heuristic evaluations, system usability scale (SUS) surveys. |
| **Cost Efficiency** | Low | Optimize infrastructure costs without sacrificing performance or availability. | Regular cost analysis using AWS Cost Explorer, utilizing AWS Reserved Instances and Spot instances where appropriate for non-critical workloads. |
| **SEO Optimization** | Low | Achieve a reasonable ranking for relevant keywords. | Keyword research, content optimization, technical SEO audits (e.g., sitemap generation, robots.txt configuration). |



**3. Refined System Design Recommendations:**

*   **Overall Architecture:** Microservices architecture remains recommended. Key services: Authentication Service, Post Service, Comment Service, User Profile Service, Search Service, Image Processing Service. API Gateway using AWS API Gateway for routing requests and managing authentication/authorization. Event-driven communication using AWS SQS & SNS.
*   **Search Functionality:**
    *   **Elasticsearch Service (AWS Managed):**  Crucial for efficient full-text search and faceted filtering. Index post content, user profiles, tags, and categories. Use Elasticsearch's analyze functionality for stemming/lemmatization to improve search accuracy.
    *   **Asynchronous Indexing:** New posts trigger an event published via SNS to a SQS queue. A worker process (e.g., AWS Lambda function) consumes these events and updates the Elasticsearch index asynchronously using the Bulk API for efficiency.
    *   **Caching:** Implement Redis caching in front of Elasticsearch to cache frequently accessed search queries, further reducing latency.  Cache invalidation strategy needs careful consideration.
*   **Image Processing:**
    *   **AWS S3:** Store original images with appropriate access controls (private).
    *   **AWS Lambda & Pillow/ImageMagick:** Upon image upload to S3, trigger an AWS Lambda function that:
        *   Generates thumbnails (small, medium, large sizes) using Pillow.
        *   Optimizes images for web delivery (e.g., WebP format).
    *   **S3 Event Notifications:**  Configure S3 event notifications to automatically trigger the Lambda function upon image upload.
    *   **Queueing (Consideration):** If image processing consistently becomes a bottleneck, introduce an AWS SQS queue between S3 and Lambda for asynchronous processing.
*   **Technology Stack Integration:**
    *   **Python/Django (with Django REST Framework):** API development and business logic.
    *   **PostgreSQL (RDS with Multi-AZ deployment):**  Database; connection pooling using PgBouncer to handle concurrency.
    *   **AWS Services:** EC2 or ECS for application servers, S3 for object storage, Lambda for serverless functions, SQS/SNS for asynchronous communication, Elasticsearch Service for search indexing, CloudFront for CDN.
    *   **Monitoring & Logging:** AWS CloudWatch for metrics and logging. Centralized log aggregation using ELK stack or Splunk for analysis and troubleshooting.  Implement alerts based on key performance indicators (KPIs).



This refined design incorporates the feedback and addresses potential bottlenecks with a focus on scalability, security, and maintainability within the chosen technology stack. Regular monitoring and proactive optimization will be essential for long-term success.  The team's moderate DevSecOps experience necessitates prioritizing training in secure coding practices and vulnerability assessment techniques to mitigate risks effectively.
