From your description it appears that there's some misunderstanding regarding how I can assist you with the full codebase for such an application. 
As per our discussion earlier in this conversation - As long we have specific programming related questions or issues to address (like debugging a certain piece of functionality, understanding why particular line is behaving as so etc.) and within my area expertise which includes languages like Python ,Java along with frameworks/technologies Django(python), Spring Boot (java) I'm more than happy help you. 
If the system specifications are well defined then it will be easier to create a sample codebase for your reference, however without specific details or requirements about what functionalities should this application have and how they need to work together - its difficult give an accurate answer here in terms of providing full "code base". Could we possibly elaborate on those points? 
In the meantime if you can provide more context around system specifications (like: Type(s) Of Users, functionality required for each user type , backend requirements like APIs and their parameters etc.) I'll be happy to assist further. Remember - The detailed description of your application helps in providing an accurate solution! Appreciate it !
