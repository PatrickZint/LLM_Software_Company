Below is a high-level system architecture for the 2D orbital simulator along with component designs and recommended technology stack selections. This design is organized into distinct modules based on the functional areas (physics, configuration, logging, visualization, and control) while keeping non-functional requirements (performance, extensibility, security, and maintainability) in mind.

1. OVERALL ARCHITECTURE

The simulator is structured as a modular Python application where each module communicates through well-defined interfaces. At a high level, the system is split into the following main blocks:

• Main Control/Orchestration Module  
• Physics Engine Module  
• Configuration Management Module  
• Data Logging Module  
• Visualization Module  

A diagrammatic view of the overall system is as follows:

         +------------------------------+
         |   Main Control/Orchestration |
         |   - Simulation loop        |

2. COMPONENT DETAILS

A. Main Control/Orchestration Module
   • Role:
     – Serves as the entry point of the application.
     – Parses the command-line arguments and loads configuration files.
     – Initializes core modules (Physics Engine, Logging, Visualization).
     – Coordinates the simulation loop, ensuring that physics calculations, data logging, and visualization updates occur in the correct sequence.
     – Handles external interrupts (e.g., KeyboardInterrupt) to allow for graceful shutdown.
   • Key Interfaces:
     – update_simulation_state(dt)
     – start_simulation(), stop_simulation()

B. Physics Engine Module
   • Role:
     – Implements gravitational force calculation using Newton’s law.
     – Computes Euclidean distance and applies safeguards (minimum r threshold) when bodies are near collision.
     – Updates positions and velocities of celestial bodies using Euler’s method (with a strategy interface for future algorithms like Runge–Kutta).
   • Internal Design & Extensibility:
     – Define a CelestialBody class (with mass, position as a NumPy 2-element array, and velocity as a NumPy array).
     – Use a strategy or factory pattern to allow switching integration schemes.
     – Leverage NumPy vectorized operations to optimize iterative calculations.
   • Public API:
     – update_positions(dt)
     – calculate_gravitational_force(body1, body2)
     – set_integration_method(method)

C. Configuration Management Module
   • Role:
     – Parses input parameters via command-line arguments (using argparse) or external configuration files (JSON/YAML/INI).
     – Validates parameters (e.g., checks for overlapping initial positions or impossible physical parameters).
     – Exposes configuration settings to other modules.
   • Key Libraries & Techniques:
     – Python’s argparse for command-line parsing.
     – json or PyYAML libraries for configuration file formats.
     – Built-in validation/sanitization routines.
   • Public API:
     – load_config(filepath) / parse_args()
     – validate_parameters(params)

D. Data Logging Module
   • Role:
     – Captures the simulation state (position, velocity, timestamp) at predefined intervals.
     – Supports different output formats such as console, plain text, and CSV.
     – Handles file operations securely following best practices.
   • Key Libraries & Techniques:
     – Python’s logging module (for console and file logging).
     – csv module for CSV formatted output.
     – Optionally, buffer data and flush outputs to disk periodically to ensure minimal latency.
   • Public API:
     – log_simulation_state(timestamp, state)
     – set_logging_frequency(N)

E. Visualization Module
   • Role:
     – Provides a 2D visualization of the simulation using Matplotlib.
     – Supports both real-time animation (using Matplotlib’s FuncAnimation) and post-simulation static plotting.
     – Offers basic interactivity (pause, zoom, pan) while remaining lightweight.
   • Dependencies & Configuration:
     – Matplotlib for plotting.
     – A toggle (via command-line/configuration) to enable or disable visualization.
   • Public API:
     – init_visualization()
     – update_plot(state)

   • Automated linters (flake8, pylint) – To ensure adherence to coding standards (e.g., PEP 8).
   • GitHub Actions, Travis CI, or an equivalent solution for continuous integration.

Development Environment:
   – Visual Studio Code or PyCharm for Integrated Development Environment (IDE).
   – Virtual environments (e.g., venv or conda) for dependency management.

Documentation:
   • Sphinx (or MkDocs) – For generating developer and user documentation based on inline comments and docstrings.
   • Markdown/README for basic user instructions.

────────────────────────────────────────
4. EXTENSIBILITY & BEST PRACTICES

• Modular Design:
   – Each module is loosely coupled to ensure that future enhancements (e.g., support for n-body simulation or alternative integration methods) can be implemented without major refactoring.

• Security & Input Validation:
   – Ensure that the configuration module thoroughly sanitizes all user inputs.
   – Use secure coding practices (following guidelines like OWASP recommendations for logging and handling of file I/O).

• Performance Optimization:
   – Use NumPy vectorized operations and pre-allocate arrays to reduce Python-level loop overhead.
   – Minimize the impact of visualization on physics calculations by decoupling update frequencies.

• Testing & Documentation:
   – Maintain an extensive test suite using pytest.
   – Document module interfaces, configuration options, and design decisions to facilitate future developers in understanding and extending the simulator.

5. SUMMARY

This high-level architecture provides a flexible, modular framework for implementing the 2D orbital simulator. By dividing responsibilities across distinct modules—each with a clear API and well-defined technology stack—the design addresses both functional requirements (gravitational physics, motion integration, logging, and visualization) and non-functional requirements (performance, usability, security, and maintainability).

The recommended Python technology stack (NumPy, Matplotlib, argparse, and logging) supports rapid prototyping and efficient computation while remaining accessible for educational purposes. This architecture lays a solid foundation for both the initial version and future enhancements of the simulator.

This design should serve as a blueprint for architects and developers as they begin the implementation, ensuring that all major functional and non-functional considerations are met while keeping the system extensible and maintainable in the long run.
