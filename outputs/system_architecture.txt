Below is a high-level system architecture that meets the specifications for the 2D N-body simulation software. This design leverages a modular, layered approach to separate concerns, support multiple numerical integration strategies, and ensure maintainability, testability, and scalability.

─────────────────────────────  
1. Architectural Overview  
─────────────────────────────

The software is divided into four primary layers or modules:

A. Simulation Core Layer  
 • Responsible for physics computations, numerical integration, and dynamic celestial body state updates.  
 • Implements a Strategy Pattern for numerical integrators (Euler, Verlet, RK4) so that integration methods can be interchanged easily.  

B. Configuration Manager  
 • Handles loading/saving simulation configuration via a JSON file.  
 • Validates configurations against a versioned and well-documented JSON schema.  
 • Provides descriptive error messages on invalid input and supports dynamic configuration reloads before simulation start.  

C. User Interface (UI) Layer  
 • Provides both a command-line interface (CLI) and an optional graphical user interface (GUI, e.g., using a lightweight toolkit).  
 • Responsible for real-time visualization of simulation progress (using Matplotlib) and interactive controls (pause/resume, simulation speed adjustments).  
 • Uses an MVC or MVVM design pattern if a GUI is implemented, segregating the simulation state (model) from the presentation (view) and user interactions (controller/view-model).  

D. Testing and Validation Module  
 • Contains unit tests for individual functions (e.g., gravitational force calculations, numerical integrators) and integration tests linking configuration with simulation operation.  
 • Integrates performance benchmarks to ensure that update cycles meet the 500-millisecond requirement for interactive simulations.  
 • Uses CI tools (e.g., GitHub Actions or Travis CI) to trigger automated test suites.

2. Component Design and Data Flow  
─────────────────────────────

Below is a component-level breakdown with an overview of the data flow:

A. Components  
 1. Configuration Manager Component  
  – Responsibilities:  
   • Read JSON configuration files.  
   • Validate configuration using a JSON Schema.  
   • Instantiate global simulation parameters and the list of celestial bodies.  
  – Interfaces: Exposes methods load_configuration() and save_configuration().

 2. Celestial Body Component  
  – Responsibilities:  
   • Encapsulate body properties (identifier, mass, position, velocity).  
   • Validate properties during instantiation.  
  – Interfaces: Provides getters/setters needed for simulation updates.

 3. Simulation Core Component  
  – Responsibilities:  
   • Compute gravitational interactions between bodies based on Newton’s law.  
   • Update body states (position and velocity) using a chosen numerical integrator.  
   • Toggle integration methods using an integration strategy interface.  
  – Key Classes:  
   • BaseIntegrator (interface)  
   • EulerIntegrator, VerletIntegrator, RK4Integrator (concrete implementations)  
  – Interfaces: start_simulation(), pause(), resume(), set_time_step(), etc.

 4. UI Component  
  – Responsibilities:  
   • Render simulation progress in real time (using Matplotlib for dynamic plots or terminal logs).  
   • Accept user actions (pause/resume, simulation speed adjustments) via CLI/GUI inputs.  
  – Interfaces: update_display(simulation_state), register_event_handlers().

 5. Logging and Error Handling Component  
  – Responsibilities:  
   • Record simulation events, configuration errors, and performance warnings.  
   • Ensure that sensitive information is not logged.  
  – Interfaces: log_info(), log_warning(), log_error().

 6. Testing and CI Component  
  – Responsibilities:  
   • Run unit and integration tests (possibly using pytest).  
   • Execute performance benchmarks.  
  – Interfaces: Test suites integrated into a CI pipeline.

B. Data Flow Sequence  
 1. Startup  
  – The Configuration Manager loads the JSON configuration file and validates its contents.  
  – Celestial Body objects are created based on this configuration.  
  – Global parameters (gravitational constant, time step, integrator selection) are set.

 2. Simulation Initialization  
  – The Simulation Core reads configuration details and instantiates the appropriate numerical integration strategy.  
  – Integration parameters are set (e.g., time step, method-specific settings).

 3. Simulation Runtime  
  – In each simulation cycle:  
   • Simulation Core calculates gravitational force between bodies and updates their states.  
   • Selected numerical integrator (via Strategy Pattern) applies the integration method.  
   • Updated simulation state is passed to the UI component for display.  
   • Logging records key events and performance data.

 4. Configuration / Control Changes  
  – Prior to simulation start, dynamic addition or removal of celestial bodies is supported via configuration reload.  
  – At runtime, UI inputs (pause/resume, speed adjustments) are captured and passed to the Simulation Core.

3. Technology Stack Selection  
─────────────────────────────

A. Core Language and Runtime  
 • Python version 3.8+  
  – Offers modern language features and broad community support.

B. Numerical Computation and Scientific Libraries  
 • NumPy  
  – Efficient array operations, vectorized computations, and optimized numerical performance essential for handling computations with many celestial bodies.

C. Visualization and Plotting  
 • Matplotlib  
  – Provides dynamic 2D plotting capabilities for real-time simulation visualization.  
  – Can be extended to interactive plots if using toolkits like Tkinter or PyQt.

D. Configuration and Data Handling  
 • JSON for configuration files  
  – Clear, human-readable format with versioned schema support (validated via libraries such as jsonschema).

E. Dependency Management and Environment  
 • virtualenv or conda  
  – Keeps Python package installations isolated and reproducible.  
 • Docker  
  – (Optional) Containerize the application for deployment consistency across environments.

F. Testing and Continuous Integration  
 • pytest  
  – Facilitates unit, integration, and performance testing.  
 • GitHub Actions, Travis CI, or similar CI tools  
  – Automate testing and ensure code quality with each commit.

G. Additional Libraries and Tools  
 • Logging: The built-in Python logging module (with careful configuration to avoid leaking sensitive data).  
 • Configuration Validation: jsonschema for enforcing JSON schema rules.  
 • (Optional) UI Toolkit: For a GUI implementation, lightweight toolkits like Tkinter (bundled with Python) or PyQt can be used.

4. Design Patterns and Best Practices  
─────────────────────────────

A. Strategy Pattern for Numerical Integration  
 • Define a common interface (e.g., BaseIntegrator) that is implemented by EulerIntegrator, VerletIntegrator, and RK4Integrator.  
 • This abstraction allows the Simulation Core to delegate integration tasks to the selected strategy.

B. MVC/MVVM Pattern for UI (if a GUI is implemented)  
 • Separates the simulation domain logic (Model) from the presentation (View) and user controls (Controller or View-Model).

C. Dependency Injection  
 • Inject configuration parameters and external dependencies (like file system access for configuration files) to simplify unit testing and enable mocks.

D. Layered Architecture  
 • Clearly separate the core simulation logic from configuration management and UI.  
 • This design aids in performance scalability, maintainability, and the future extension of system components (e.g., adding collision detection).
