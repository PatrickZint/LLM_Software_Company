Below is a high-level system architecture design that meets the project’s requirements. This design outlines clear component responsibilities, modular separations, and a layered approach that embraces extensibility while ensuring performance and security.

────────────────────────────
1. OVERALL LAYERED ARCHITECTURE

The architecture is divided into three major layers:

A. Presentation Layer (User Interface & Visualization)  
 • Responsibilities:  
  – Handle real‐time interactive 3D visualization using VPython.  
  – Provide intuitive control interfaces (e.g., playback controls, simulation parameter entry, camera operations).  
  – Display simulation metadata and allow user selection of simulation entities for further inspection.

B. Service/Business Logic Layer (Simulation & Data Processing)  
 • Responsibilities:  
  – Core Simulation Engine: Implements the gravitational physics model, numerical integration (RK4/Verlet), and basic simulation loop control.  
  – Collision Manager: Detects collisions (using spatial partitioning such as octrees or grids) and applies merge or bounce logic.  
  – Data Export & Logging: Records simulation state and events and supports both CSV and HDF5 (via h5py) output.  
  – Event & Command Manager: Coordinates user interactions (pause, restart, speed change) and forwards commands to underlying modules in an event-driven manner.

C. Persistence & Security Layer  
 • Responsibilities:  
  – Secure File I/O: Manage read/write operations to HDF5 files and configuration files securely.  
  – Configuration Management: Use environment variables/secure key management and containerized isolation (e.g., Docker) to ensure vulnerability management.  
  – Logging and Error Management: Centralized logging for simulation events and error tracking, with secure audit routines.

2. COMPONENT DESIGN

A. Simulation Engine Component  
 • Modules:  
  1. Physics Module:  
   – Implements Newtonian gravitational calculations using Numpy.  
   – Offers two integration methods (RK4 and Verlet) and allows future adaptation (e.g., relativistic corrections).  
   – Exposes calibration parameters (time step, simulation duration, numerical tolerances).  
  2. Collision Detection & Resolution Module:  
   – Uses efficient data structures (e.g., octrees or uniform grids) to perform spatial partitioning.  
   – Includes two resolution sub-modules: Merge Mode (mass/momentum conservation) and Bounce Mode (elastic/inelastic collisions).  
   – Offers configuration parameters via a UI or config file.  
  3. Simulation Controller:  
   – Main loop coordinator that invokes physics calculations, manages event scheduling, and synchronizes with visualization.  
   – Uses asynchronous design patterns (e.g., event queues) to avoid blocking critical routines (such as physics computation).

B. Visualization & User Interface Component  
 • Modules:  
  1. VPython Rendering Module:  
   – Leverages VPython for real-time 3D display, camera control (pan, zoom, rotate), and trajectory trails.  
   – Implements level-of-detail logic to maintain performance during heavy loads.  
  2. GUI Controls Module:  
   – Provides simulation parameter input forms, collision mode selectors, and playback controls (start, pause, step, restart, speed adjustment).  
   – Offers interactive tooltips/channels for user guidance and on-screen help.
  3. Event Handler & Command Dispatcher:  
   – Listens for UI input events and dispatches corresponding commands to the simulation engine via the Service Layer.
   – Implements a responsive controller to meet latency performance targets.

C. Data Management & Export Component  
 • Modules:  
  1. Logging Module:  
   – Captures simulation state (positions, velocities, energies, etc.) periodically based on user-configured intervals.  
  2. Export Module:  
   – Supports CSV export for ad-hoc analysis.  
   – Uses h5py to manage HDF5 exports, including embedding metadata (simulation start time, configuration, units).  
   – Runs asynchronously to avoid impacting the simulation’s main loop.

D. Security and Integration Component  
 • Modules:  
  1. Secure Access Manager:  
   – Handles authentication and authorization (if remote or multi-user access is implemented) following OWASP guidelines.  
   – Manages sensitive configuration (using environment variables and secure storage).
  2. Container & Dependency Manager:  
   – Uses virtual environments (virtualenv or pipenv) and containerization (Docker) to manage dependencies and enforce consistent deployments.  
  3. Error And Logging Monitor:  
   – Centralizes logging for simulation events, performance benchmarks, and critical errors.  
   – Provides audit trails and triggers alerts for anomalies.

3. TECHNOLOGY STACK SELECTION

Based on the requirements and environment specifications, the selected technology stack is as follows:

• Programming Language & Runtime:  
 – Python 3.8+  
  • Chosen for its extensive ecosystem, ease of rapid development, and robust numerical libraries.

• Numerical Processing:  
 – Numpy (v1.21+)  
  • Optimized for large-scale array operations and vectorized computations necessary for gravitational simulations.

• 3D Visualization:  
 – VPython  
  • Provides built-in real-time 3D rendering with support for interactive camera controls and hardware acceleration when available.

• Data Storage & Export:  
 – HDF5 via h5py

 – CSV handling using Python’s built-in CSV module or Pandas for lightweight export scenarios.

• Dependency & Environment Management:  
 – Virtualenv or Pipenv for local development environments.  
 – Docker for containerized deployments, ensuring consistency across platforms.

• Security & Best Practices:  
 – Use Python libraries such as cryptography for encryption where needed, and standard security modules to enforce best practices.  
 – Environment variable management (e.g., using python-dotenv) to securely handle sensitive configuration data.

• Testing & CI/CD:  
 – Unit testing with pytest.  
 – Integration and UI tests using frameworks like selenium (for GUI component testing) and performance profiling tools.  
 – CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions or GitLab CI configured to run in containerized environments.

4. INTEGRATION & EVENT FLOW

• Initialization Phase:  
 – Startup routines load configuration settings (from a secure file or environment variables), instantiate simulation parameters, and initialize the Physics, Collision, Logging, and Visualization modules.

• Simulation Execution Phase:  
 – The Simulation Controller begins the main loop, performing calculation ticks at configured intervals.  
 – Each tick involves updating body positions (physics module), executing collision checks (collision detection module), and asynchronously dispatching logs/events (logging/export module).  
 – The VPython visualization layer continuously updates the scene based on the simulation's current state.

• User Interaction Phase:  
 – User inputs received via the GUI are handled by the Event Handler, which dispatches commands (e.g., pause, speed adjustment) to the simulation engine and visualization modules.
 – Real-time feedback is provided, and any change in simulation settings is reflected immediately in the next simulation tick.

• Data Export and Shutdown Phase:  
 – At user request or periodic intervals, the Export Module packages simulation data into CSV and/or HDF5 formats.  
 – During shutdown, the system ensures that logs and data dumps are finalized, and any open secure channels are terminated cleanly.
