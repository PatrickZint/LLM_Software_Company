Below is a high-level system architecture for the 2D orbital simulator that meets both the detailed functional and non‐functional requirements. This design decomposes the system into three main layers with clearly separated responsibilities, while selecting a technology stack that leverages Python’s rich numerical and visualization libraries.

──────────────────────────────
1. Overall Architectural Layers

A. Core Simulation Engine Layer  
 • Responsibility:  
  – Implements Newtonian physics, gravitational force computations, kinematic updating, and configurable numerical integration (e.g., Euler method or a higher-order method).  
  – Manages simulation timing and error detection (e.g., warnings on unstable simulation behavior).  
 • Features:  
  – Encapsulated “physics engine” module that can operate in “batch” mode for logging and file exports, as well as integrated with visualization when needed.  
  – Fully decoupled from the user I/O and visualization modules to allow for independent testing and future extension (such as adding multi-body or 3D support).

B. Data I/O Layer  
 • Responsibility:  
  – Handles input validation, configuration parsing (e.g., command-line flags or configuration files defined in JSON/YAML), and logging.  
  – Exports simulation results (positions, velocities, forces over time) to multiple formats such as CSV, JSON, or standard output.  
 • Features:  
  – Configurable verbosity levels to control the log details (from basic state variables to full computation trace).  
  – Use of Python’s logging module for structured logging and audit trails.

C. Visualization Layer  
 • Responsibility:  
  – Provides both static plots and animated, interactive 2D visualization of the celestial bodies’ trajectories using Matplotlib.  
  – Optionally allows for interactive controls (pause/resume, speed adjustment) – either implemented as simple command-line key commands or a minimal GUI.  
 • Features:  
  – Clearly labeled axes, legends, distinct marker colors, and scaling controls for intuitive user experience.  
  – Isolation from the core simulation allows the visualization to be optionally enabled without impacting computational performance.

2. Component Design Overview

A. Simulation Engine Module  
 • Components:  
  1. Physics Calculator  
   – Computes gravitational forces using F = G·(m₁*m₂)/r² with proper 2D vector handling.  
   – Computes accelerations (a = F/m) and supports multiple integration strategies (e.g., Euler and potential higher-order methods).  
  2. Integrator  
   – Provides configurable time stepping and numerical integration routines.  
   – Monitors simulation conditions and issues warnings if numerical divergence or instability is detected.  
  3. Time-Step Manager  
   – Manages simulation iterations using user-specified time-step size and total simulation duration.

B. Data I/O Module  
 • Components:  
  1. Configuration Parser  
   – Uses libraries such as argparse (for command-line) or a JSON/YAML parser for file configuration.  
   – Validates inputs such as initial conditions, masses, time-step, and simulation duration.  
  2. Logger  
   – Employs Python’s logging module to log simulation events, error conditions, and state variables for debugging and audit logging.  
   – Provides options to export output in CSV or JSON formats, and supports different levels of verbosity.

C. Visualization Module  
 • Components:  
  1. Plot Manager  
   – Uses Matplotlib to produce static trajectory plots and animated simulations.  
   – Implements clear labeling (axes, legends) and marker differentiation for the bodies.  
  2. User Interaction Controller  
   – Optionally integrates interactive controls (e.g., pausing/resuming and adjusting simulation speed).  
   – Could use Matplotlib’s interactive backends or minimal GUI elements (e.g., Tkinter) if needed.

3. Technology Stack Selection

• Primary Language: Python  
 – Advantages: Wide availability of scientific computing libraries, ease of prototyping, and readability.  
 – Best Practices: Use virtual environments and dependency managers (pip or Poetry) to manage packages.

• Numerical Computation: NumPy  
 – Purpose: For efficient vectorized operations and matrix math during physics calculations.  
 – Benefit: Improved performance (target <200ms per simulation step) even under interactive simulation conditions.

• Advanced Integration (Optional): SciPy  
 – Purpose: To offer more accurate and advanced numerical integration methods if needed.  
 – Benefit: Allows switching from simple Euler integration to higher-order methods on demand.

• Visualization: Matplotlib  
 – Purpose: Rendering 2D plots and animations of orbital trajectories.  
 – Benefit: High configurability for both static plot outputs and interactive displays with built-in interactivity features.

• Configuration and Logging:  
 – argparse for command-line arguments and JSON/YAML libraries for configuration files.  
 – Python’s logging module for structured and audit logging.

4. Interaction Flow Summary

Step 1: Input and Configuration  
 • The user supplies initial conditions and simulation parameters (via command-line or a configuration file).  
 • The Configuration Parser validates inputs.

Step 2: Simulation Engine Execution  
 • The Physics Calculator computes forces, accelerations, and positions using the chosen numerical integrator.  
 • The Time-Step Manager iterates over the simulation duration and monitors potential numerical issues.

Step 3: Data I/O Operations  
 • After each time step (or in batches), the simulation state is logged at the configured verbosity level through the Logger.  
 • Outputs are exported to CSV or JSON formats as required.

Step 4: Visualization (Optional)  
 • If visualization is enabled, the Plot Manager captures simulation data in real time to produce animated plots.  
 • The User Interaction Controller allows users to pause or adjust simulation speed on the fly.

5. Modularity and Extensibility Considerations

• Loose Coupling:  
 – Each module (simulation, I/O, visualization) communicates via well-defined interfaces (e.g., data objects that represent state at each time step).  
 – This makes it straightforward to replace the numerical integrator or extend the simulation engine to include more bodies or a third dimension later on.

• Testability:  
 – Unit tests should be implemented for the physics calculations (e.g., verifying gravitational force and kinematics outcomes) using known physical scenarios such as circular or elliptical orbits.  
 – Integration tests can validate that configuration inputs lead to expected simulation behavior.

• Security:  
 – Input validation routines are in place to check user-supplied values.  
 – Secure coding practices following OWASP and industry standards ensure robustness even as the system evolves.

6. Conclusion

This high-level architecture clearly delineates the responsibilities into a Core Simulation Engine, Data I/O, and Visualization layer. Using Python, NumPy, and Matplotlib ensures that the simulator meets performance (sub-200ms simulation step), ease of use, and extensibility requirements while remaining modular enough to support future enhancements. Each module’s clear boundaries allow for independent development, testing, and future scalability—fulfilling all specified functional and non‐functional requirements.
