Okay, this is *excellent*! This refined specification truly addresses the nuances of the scenario and provides a solid foundation for architectural planning. The inclusion of risk mitigation strategies is particularly valuable.

Let's tackle those remaining questions from sections 2 and 3 to solidify the architecture even further. I’ll provide answers representing likely decisions given the budget, timeline, and stakeholder preferences.  I will group them by section for clarity.

**Section 2: Further Refinement - Addressing Open Questions**

*   **Data Storage – PostgreSQL or MySQL?** While both are viable, PostgreSQL offers better support for advanced data types (like JSONB), stronger transaction guarantees, and generally a more robust feature set, especially considering the potential need for encryption at rest.  Given the cybersecurity focus of the content, **PostgreSQL is preferred.**
*   **Caching Strategy – Redis or Memcached?** Both are good choices. Redis offers more features (data structures, persistence) but adds complexity. For this scenario, with a relatively low initial load and focusing on simplicity, **Memcached is initially sufficient**.  Redis can be integrated later if performance demands increase significantly.
*   **Search Implementation – Native PostgreSQL Search or Dedicated Search Engine (Elasticsearch/Solr)?** Native PostgreSQL search will suffice for the initial scope (limited posts & users). Elasticsearch would provide far superior indexing and relevance ranking, but adds significant operational overhead. **Start with PostgreSQL's full-text search; evaluate Elasticsearch after 6 months based on user feedback and performance metrics.**
*   **Task Queue – Celery or RQ?** Both are Python task queues. RQ (Redis Queue) is simpler to set up and use, especially when paired with Memcached. **RQ is preferred for ease of integration and faster time-to-market.**  Celery could be considered later if more complex routing/workflow management is needed.
*   **Frontend Framework – React, Vue.js, or Angular?** Given the small team’s likely limited JavaScript expertise (they chose WordPress initially), **Vue.js offers a good balance of ease of learning and power**. It's progressively adoptable, allowing them to build components incrementally without needing to fully rewrite everything at once.
*   **Deployment Environment – AWS, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), or Azure?** Given the need for cost-effectiveness, **AWS is preferred due to its mature ecosystem, extensive documentation, and competitive pricing.** Specifically, using Elastic Beanstalk for simplified deployment initially.  Containerization with Docker and orchestration with ECS/Fargate can be considered later as complexity grows.
*   **Authentication – JWT or OAuth2?** For a standalone blog platform, **JWT (JSON Web Tokens) is sufficient for authentication**. OAuth2 is more complex and primarily needed for integrating with third-party providers.
*   **Monitoring & Alerting – Prometheus + Grafana or CloudWatch/Stackdriver?**  Prometheus + Grafana offer greater flexibility and community support but require more configuration. For a smaller team, **AWS CloudWatch provides easier integration within the AWS ecosystem.**

**Section 3: Addressing Design Recommendations - Clarifications & Decisions**

*   **Microservices Architecture – Timeline for Evaluation:** The original recommendation was to consider it. Given budget and timeline constraints, *full microservice adoption is not feasible initially*. However, **designing with modularity in mind from the start (e.g., well-defined API boundaries) will make a future transition easier.**  A "monolith" architecture with clear separation of concerns is acceptable for now.
*   **API Design – Versioning Strategy:** Implement semantic versioning (`v1`, `v2`) for APIs to allow for backwards-compatible changes without breaking existing integrations (particularly if Mailchimp integration comes later).
*   **Event-Driven Architecture – Initial Scope:**  Initially, focus on using the task queue (RQ) for asynchronous tasks like sending email notifications. A full-fledged message queue system (RabbitMQ/Kafka) is overkill at this stage.
*   **CI/CD Pipeline - Tooling:** Use **GitHub Actions** for CI/CD pipeline integration within GitHub. It's free for public repositories and offers a good set of features for simple deployments to AWS Elastic Beanstalk.
*   **Monitoring & Logging – Detailed Metrics:** Beyond CloudWatch, implement application-level logging using a structured logging format (e.g., JSON). Key metrics to monitor: request latency, error rates, database connection pool utilization, CPU/memory usage on servers.

Now, armed with these answers, please refine the high-level system architecture diagram and technology stack selection accordingly. I am looking for you to synthesize all of this information into a cohesive architectural blueprint. Focus on presenting it in a clear, concise manner suitable for discussion with the development team (even if that is just me!).  Include:

1.  **A High-Level Architectural Diagram:** A visual representation showing key components and their interactions.
2.  **Technology Stack Summary:** A table outlining the chosen technologies for each layer of the architecture.
3.  **Deployment Architecture Overview:** Brief description of how the application will be deployed on AWS, including services used (Elastic Beanstalk, RDS, etc.)
