Okay, this is excellent! This is exactly what I was looking for - comprehensive and well-structured.  Let's address the open questions and make some final clarifications.

**Addressing Open Questions & Final Clarifications:**

*   **Stakeholder Confirmation of Performance Metrics:** The 50ms calculation time is acceptable *as a target*, but realistically, anything under 100ms is perfectly fine for this application. User perception will be more important than strict adherence to the 50ms limit.
*   **Font Size Specification:** Minimum acceptable font size should be 12pt for both display and buttons.  Larger fonts are preferred if feasible without overcrowding the UI, but 12pt is the absolute minimum.
*   **Thousand Separator Preference:** **No thousand separators.** We want a clean numerical display.
*   **Deployment Environment:** The application will be deployed on individual Windows 10/11 desktops for personal use within an office environment.  Simple distribution (e.g., sharing the `.py` file and potentially creating an executable) is sufficient – no complex deployment infrastructure required.
*   **Error Message Specificity**: Let's go with slightly more specific error messages than just "Invalid Input". These are preferred:
    *   "Cannot divide by zero" (for division by zero attempts).
    *   "Too many decimal points" (when a user enters multiple decimal points in the same number).
    *  “Consecutive Operators” for when users enter operators directly after each other without numbers.

**Revised System Specifications (Incorporating Clarifications):**

I'll update the existing document with these clarifications, highlighting the changes.

## Simple Calculator - System Specifications

**1. Functional Requirements:** (As refined previously)

*   …[No Changes]…
*   **FR4.1 Invalid Input Handling:** The calculator should handle invalid input gracefully:
    *   Multiple decimal points within a single number. Display “Too many decimal points” error message.
    *   Entering operators consecutively without numbers.  Display "Consecutive Operators" error message.
    *   Non-numeric characters (other than `.`). Display "Invalid Input" error message.
    *   **FR4.2 Overflow/Underflow:** A message like "Overflow" or "Underflow" could be displayed if results exceed the representable range of floating-point numbers.

*   …[No Changes]…



**2. Non-Functional Requirements:**

*   …[No Changes]…
*   **NFR3.0 Performance:**
    *   Calculations must complete within 50 milliseconds under normal load (single user).  Realistically, anything under 100ms is acceptable for this application.
    *   The UI should respond to button presses with no noticeable delay (<100ms).

**3. System Design Recommendations & Technical Specifications:**

*   …[No Changes]…
*   **Data Representation:** Use Python's built-in `float` type for representing numbers.
*   **Error Handling Implementation:** Utilize Python’s exception handling (`try...except`) blocks for robust error management, particularly for division by zero and invalid input scenarios. Display user-friendly error messages within the UI.
*   **Input Validation:** Implement comprehensive input validation in `calculator_logic.py` *before* performing any calculations. This should include checks for:
    *   Valid numeric characters (digits and decimal point).
    *   Maximum number of decimal points.
    *   Consecutive operators.
*   **Testing Strategy:**  Implement a suite of unit tests using `pytest` to verify the correctness of the calculation logic, error handling, and input validation. Focus on edge cases and boundary conditions.
* **Security Considerations (Implemented through Code):**
    *   **Input Sanitization:** While not strictly applicable due to the calculator's limited scope, treat all user input as potentially malicious.  Sanitize inputs by removing any characters that are not digits or operators before processing them. This is a preventative measure against unexpected behavior.
    *   **Limited Functionality:** Keep the functionality extremely simple to minimize the attack surface. No external calls or network connections should be made.

**4. Open Questions & Dependencies (to be addressed):**

*  This section is now complete and no further questions remain.

**5. UI Specifics (Tkinter) - Additional Detail**
 * **FR5.2 Font Size:** The font size used for the display and buttons should be 12pt as a minimum.

With these clarifications, I believe we have a fully specified system ready for development! Thank you for your detailed and thoughtful approach to this task.
