Okay, thank you for the incredibly detailed and helpful feedback! You've pinpointed several crucial areas where I can significantly improve the specificity and completeness of the documentation. Let's address those points and refine both sections accordingly.

Here’s a revised version incorporating your suggestions, with additions highlighted in **bold**.  I will also outline the reasoning behind these changes.

## Calculator System Specifications (Revised)

**1. Understanding:** As before, this section remains unchanged as it establishes context.

**2. Refined Requirements:**

*   **FR1: Input Handling – User Interaction & Operator Format:**
    *   Users will interact with the calculator through a graphical user interface (GUI).
    *   Operators (+, -, *, /) will be provided via **dedicated buttons on the GUI**. Direct text input of operators is *not* supported in this initial release.
    *   Numbers will be entered either by clicking numeric buttons or directly typing into an input field.  **The input field will only accept numerical characters (0-9) and a decimal point.**
*   **FR2: Calculation Logic – Order of Operations:**
    *   Calculations will follow the standard order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS). **For this initial release, if PEMDAS/BODMAS is not implemented, calculations will be performed strictly from left to right. This limitation will be explicitly documented in the user manual.** Future releases *should* incorporate full PEMDAS/BODMAS support ("Should Have" priority – see prioritization section below).
*   **FR3: Error Handling – Overflow/Underflow & Precision:**
    *   The calculator utilizes Python's floating-point arithmetic. **While Python’s float type has a large range, the display will switch to scientific notation when results exceed +/- 1e+15 or are smaller than +/- 1e-15.**  An error message "Result exceeds display limits" will be displayed in these cases.
    *   **The calculator will display numbers with a maximum of 10 decimal places.** This limit is imposed to prevent excessive precision and improve readability.
*   **FR4: Display - Formatting:**
    *   Numbers on the display will be formatted as follows:
        *   **Maximum width of 20 characters.**
        *   **No thousands separators (commas) for numbers less than 1,000.**
        *   **Thousands separators will be used for numbers greater than or equal to 1,000 (e.g., 1,000,000).**
        *   **The decimal point character will be '.' (period).**

**3. Prioritization (MoSCoW):**

*   **Must Have:** FR1, FR2, FR3, FR4 – *Core functionality is essential for the calculator to operate.*
*   **Should Have:**  Full PEMDAS/BODMAS implementation (future release) – *Important but not critical for initial launch.*
*   **Could Have:** Support for more advanced functions (square root, exponents, trigonometric functions) - *Desirable but can be deferred.*
*   **Won't Have:** Direct text input of operators.  – *Not planned for this release.*

**4. Challenges:** As before, this section remains largely the same with an added point: “Implementing PEMDAS/BODMAS requires careful consideration to avoid precedence errors.”

**5. Next Steps:** As before, this section remains largely the same.

## Environment Profile (Revised)

**1. Understanding:**  As before.

**2. Refined Profile:**

*   **Deployment Environment:** **The calculator will be deployed as a web application using Flask (Python framework). It will run on an Apache web server behind a load balancer.** This decision enables accessibility from various devices and simplifies maintenance.
*   **Scalability:**  **The system should be horizontally scalable to handle up to 100 concurrent users with an average response time of less than 200 milliseconds for simple calculations (e.g., addition, subtraction). Response times for more complex calculations (involving multiple operations) should not exceed 500 milliseconds.** This requires a robust database and efficient caching mechanisms.
*   **Data Storage:** **The calculator does not require persistent storage of calculation history. All data is transient and processed in memory.** Therefore, a database is *not* required for this initial release.
*   **Security:**
    *   **Authentication/Authorization:**  **No user authentication or authorization will be implemented initially. The application will be publicly accessible.** (This should be revisited as a future security enhancement).
    *   **Input Validation:** All input must be rigorously validated to prevent injection attacks and ensure data integrity. **The GUI framework will provide built-in validation features, which must be utilized extensively.**
    *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** **Automated vulnerability scanning will be performed weekly using OWASP ZAP.**
    *   **Secure Coding Practices:**  Developers *must* adhere to secure coding guidelines (e.g., avoid using `eval()` or other potentially unsafe functions).
*   **Compliance Requirements:** **This calculator application is not subject to any specific regulatory compliance requirements at this time.**

**3. Challenges:** As before, with added point: "Ensuring horizontal scalability will require careful optimization of the Flask application and efficient caching strategies."

**4. Next Steps:** As before.

**Reasoning for Changes & Addressing Your Feedback:**

*   **Operator Input:** Clarified that dedicated buttons are used initially, explicitly stating limitations on direct text input.
*   **Order of Operations:** Added an explicit statement about left-to-right evaluation if PEMDAS/BODMAS isn't implemented and flagged it as a "Should Have" for future development.
*   **Overflow/Underflow & Precision:** Specified how the calculator will handle extreme values (scientific notation, error messages) and limited decimal places on display.
*   **Display Formatting:** Added specific formatting rules for numbers.
*   **Deployment Environment:**  Defined a web application architecture with Flask and Apache.
*   **Scalability:** Provided quantifiable scalability targets (concurrent users, response times).
*   **Data Storage:** Explicitly stated that no persistent data storage is needed initially.
*   **Security:** Added details about input validation, vulnerability scanning, and secure coding practices, plus acknowledging the lack of authentication/authorization in this phase.
* **Compliance Requirements**: Clarified lack of requirements for now.

I believe these revisions significantly enhance both documents, addressing your pointed feedback and providing a more comprehensive and actionable foundation for development. Thank you again for your excellent guidance! Do you have any further suggestions?
