Okay, fantastic! Let's refine the system architecture based on these updated specifications. Here’s a comprehensive plan addressing functional requirements, prioritized non-functional requirements, and refined design recommendations.

**1. Detailed Functional Requirements:**

*   **User Roles & Authentication:**
    *   **Registration:** Users can register with email/password, or via social login (Google, Facebook).  Email verification required upon registration.
    *   **Login:** Secure authentication using industry-standard password hashing (bcrypt) and session management. Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) optional but encouraged.
    *   **User Profiles:** Users can create and edit profiles with basic information (username, bio, profile picture).  Privacy settings to control visibility of profile information.
    *   **Role Management:** Admin roles capable of managing user accounts (suspension, deletion), content moderation, and system configuration. Regular users have limited self-management capabilities.
    *   **Password Reset:** Secure password reset flow via email verification.

*   **Post Functionality:**
    *   **Create Post:** Users can create posts with text, images, videos, and links.  Rich text editor (e.g., TinyMCE or Quill) for formatting. Character limit on post content.
    *   **Edit/Delete Posts:** Users can edit/delete their own posts. Admins can edit/delete any post.
    *   **Post Visibility:** Options to make posts public, private (only visible to the user), or restricted to specific groups.
    *   **Tagging:**  Users can tag other users in posts. Tagged users receive notifications.
    *   **Categorization:** Posts can be assigned categories for improved organization and searchability.

*   **Comment Functionality:**
    *   **Create Comment:** Users can comment on posts. Rich text editor for formatting comments.
    *   **Edit/Delete Comments:** Users can edit/delete their own comments. Admins can edit/delete any comment.
    *   **Nested Comments (Replies):** Support for threaded conversations through nested comments.
    *   **Comment Moderation:** Admins can moderate comments, marking them as spam or offensive.  Option to flag inappropriate comments by users.

*   **Platform Features:**
    *   **Search:** Robust search functionality across posts and user profiles (see design recommendations below).
    *   **Notifications:** Real-time notifications for new followers, mentions, comments on their posts, etc., using WebSockets or Server-Sent Events (SSE).
    *   **Following/Followers:** Users can follow other users.  A feed displaying posts from followed users.
    *   **Content Feed:** Algorithmically curated content feed based on user interests and activity. Implement A/B testing to optimize ranking algorithms.
    *   **Image Upload & Processing:** Users can upload images; these are stored securely, resized for different display sizes (thumbnails, medium, large), and optimized for web delivery.  (See design recommendations below).
    *   **Reporting Mechanism:** Allow users to report content or users that violate community guidelines.



**2. Prioritized Non-Functional Requirements:**

| Requirement | Priority | Target | Testing Strategy |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Security (Authentication & Authorization)** | High | No unauthorized access; pass OWASP top 10 tests.  | Penetration testing, code reviews, security scans (SAST/DAST). |
| **Performance – Search Response Time** | High | < 200ms for common search queries. | Load testing with realistic data volume, performance monitoring of database and search index. |
| **Scalability - User Capacity** | High | Support up to 1 million active users without significant performance degradation. | Scalability testing by gradually increasing user load and monitoring system resources.  Autoscaling configuration in AWS. |
| **Availability** | High | 99.9% uptime. | Continuous monitoring, automated failover mechanisms, regular backups and disaster recovery drills. |
| **Performance – Image Processing Time** | Medium | < 1 second for image resizing/optimization on upload. |  Load testing with high volumes of image uploads; monitor CPU usage and queue lengths. |
| **Maintainability & Code Quality** | Medium | Adherence to coding standards, comprehensive test coverage (80% or higher). | Static code analysis, automated unit and integration tests, regular code reviews. |
| **Usability** | Medium |  High user satisfaction based on usability testing. | User interviews, A/B testing of UI elements, heuristic evaluations. |
| **Cost Efficiency** | Low | Optimize infrastructure costs without sacrificing performance or availability. | Regular cost analysis, utilizing AWS Reserved Instances and Spot instances where appropriate. |
| **SEO Optimization** | Low |  Achieve a reasonable ranking for relevant keywords. | Keyword research, content optimization, technical SEO audits. |



**3. Refined System Design Recommendations:**

*   **Overall Architecture (Reinforcing Previous Recommendations):** Microservices architecture is still recommended as we scale. Core services: Authentication Service, Post Service, Comment Service, User Profile Service, Search Service, Image Processing Service.  API Gateway for routing requests. Event-driven communication using AWS SQS or SNS between microservices.

*   **Search Functionality (Addressing Bottleneck):**
    *   **Elasticsearch:**  Crucial for efficient full-text search and faceted filtering. Index post content, user profiles, tags, and categories.
    *   **Asynchronous Indexing:** When a new post is created or updated, add an event to SQS. A worker process consumes these events and updates the Elasticsearch index asynchronously. Prevents blocking the main application flow.
    *   **Caching:** Implement caching at various levels (e.g., Redis for frequently accessed search results) to further reduce latency.

*   **Image Processing (Addressing Bottleneck):**
    *   **AWS S3:** Store original images in S3 with appropriate access controls.
    *   **AWS Lambda & ImageMagick/Pillow:**  When an image is uploaded, trigger an AWS Lambda function. The Lambda function uses libraries like ImageMagick or Pillow to:
        *   Generate thumbnails (small, medium, large sizes).
        *   Optimize images for web delivery (e.g., using WebP format if supported by browsers).
    *   **S3 Event Notifications:** Configure S3 event notifications to trigger the Lambda function automatically upon image upload.
    *   **Queueing:** If image processing becomes a significant bottleneck, introduce an AWS SQS queue between S3 and Lambda to handle bursts of uploads gracefully.

*   **Technology Stack Considerations & Integration (Building on Previous Choices):**
    *   **Python/Django:** Provides rapid development and scalability.  Use Django REST Framework for building APIs.
    *   **PostgreSQL:** Robust, ACID-compliant database. Consider using connection pooling (e.g., PgBouncer) to handle a large number of concurrent connections.
    *   **AWS Services:**
        *   EC2/ECS/EKS: Container orchestration depending on complexity. EKS offers more scalability and advanced features if the team gains experience.
        *   S3: Object storage for images, videos, and other static assets.
        *   Lambda: Serverless functions for image processing and background tasks.
        *   SQS/SNS: Message queuing and pub-sub services for asynchronous communication between microservices.
        *   Elasticsearch Service (or self-managed on EC2): Managed Elasticsearch cluster simplifies operations.
        *   CloudFront: CDN for distributing static assets globally and improving performance.
    *   **Monitoring & Logging:**  AWS CloudWatch for monitoring system metrics, application logs, and alerting. Centralized logging using tools like ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or Splunk.



This refined architecture addresses the updated requirements and anticipated bottlenecks while emphasizing scalability, security, and maintainability. Continuous integration/continuous delivery is essential to manage this complexity. Regular code reviews with a focus on DevSecOps principles are also crucial given the team's moderate experience in this area - providing training should be prioritized.  Remember that this is an iterative process; ongoing monitoring and optimization will be key to ensuring long-term success.
