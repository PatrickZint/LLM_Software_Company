Okay, excellent! This is a very thorough and well-defined set of specifications. Let's focus on elaborating on the **database schema** and the **authentication flow with JWT**. I think those are two crucial areas to solidify early on.

**1. Database Schema Design:**

Please provide a detailed database schema proposal, including:

*   Table names
*   Column names within each table (with data types - e.g., `VARCHAR(255)`, `INTEGER`, `BOOLEAN`, `TIMESTAMP`)
*   Primary keys and foreign key relationships between tables
*   Considerations for indexing to optimize query performance based on common search/filtering criteria (e.g., searching by author, genre).

**2. Authentication Flow with JWT:**

Please outline a detailed authentication flow using JWT tokens, covering:

*   User Registration process (what data is stored?)
*   Login Process (how are credentials verified? How is the JWT generated and what claims does it contain?)
*   How the JWT will be used for subsequent API requests (where will it be sent and how will it be validated on each endpoint?)
*   Token Refresh Mechanism (if desired - to avoid users constantly needing to re-login)
*   Security considerations â€“  how will you protect against common JWT vulnerabilities like replay attacks or token theft?



Let's start with those two areas. I want to ensure we have a robust and secure foundation before moving on to other aspects of the architecture.
