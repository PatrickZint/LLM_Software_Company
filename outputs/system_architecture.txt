### 2.1 Presentation Layer

**Purpose:** Manages all user interactions, including input collection and result display, using Tkinter for the GUI.

**Components:**

- **Main Window:**
  - Initializes the primary application window.
  - Configures window properties (size, title, layout).

- **Display Screen:**
  - Shows current inputs, ongoing operations, and final results.
  - Updates dynamically based on user interactions and calculations.

- **Button Panel:**
  - Contains all calculator buttons organized in a grid layout.
  - Includes digits (0-9), decimal point, arithmetic operators (`+`, `−`, `×`, `÷`), clear functions (`CE`, `C`), and equals (`=`).

- **Keyboard Input Handler:**
  - Captures and processes keyboard inputs.
  - Maps keyboard events to corresponding button actions.

**Interactions:**

- **User Input:**
  - Users interact via mouse clicks on buttons or keyboard inputs.
  - Inputs are forwarded to the Business Logic Layer for processing.

- **Display Updates:**
  - Receives updates from the Business Logic Layer to reflect current state and results.

### 2.2 Business Logic Layer

**Purpose:** Handles all computational operations, input validations, and state management.

**Components:**

- **Calculator Engine:**
  - Performs arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
  - Handles operation chaining and respects the order of operations.

- **Input Validator:**
  - Ensures that all user inputs are valid.
  - Prevents invalid sequences (e.g., multiple decimals, consecutive operators).

- **State Manager:**
  - Maintains the current state of the calculator (current input, ongoing operations, previous results).
  - Manages transitions between different states based on user actions.

- **Error Handler:**
  - Detects and manages errors (e.g., division by zero, invalid inputs).
  - Communicates error messages to the Presentation Layer.

**Interactions:**

- **Receives Inputs:**
  - Accepts validated inputs from the Presentation Layer.
