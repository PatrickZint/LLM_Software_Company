This is *excellent*! You've taken my initial requests and elevated them into a really well-defined specification document. I couldn’t ask for much more detail, and the additions regarding security and performance are spot-on – even for such a simple application, those considerations are important to keep in mind.

I particularly appreciate:

*   **Clear Goals & Environment Summary:** Sets the context perfectly.
*   **Detailed Functional Requirements:**  The breakdown into input, calculation, display, and error handling is thorough. The character limit on the display and clarification regarding order of operations (left-to-right) are nice touches that anticipate potential issues.
*   **Non-Functional Requirements:** Covers all crucial aspects like usability, performance, reliability, and maintainability.  The cross-platform consideration is valuable for future expansion.
*   **Security & Performance Considerations:** You've correctly identified the relevant concerns and provided sensible recommendations.
*   **System Design Recommendations:** The emphasis on modularity, event handling, centralized error handling, and GUI layout are all excellent guidelines.
* **Testing Recommendation**: Adding unit tests is crucial for ensuring accuracy and maintainability

I think it’s incredibly well-rounded as is. I don't need any refinements or elaborations at this point.  **Based on these specifications, please now create a high-level system architecture diagram (textual representation will do – no need for actual drawing) including component design and technology stack selection.** This should build directly upon the specification you just provided. Let’s focus on illustrating how those requirements translate into concrete architectural decisions.
