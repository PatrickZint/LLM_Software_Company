# High-Level System Architecture for Simple Calculator Application

## **1. Introduction**

This document presents a high-level system architecture for the **Simple Calculator** application developed in Python using the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface (GUI). The architecture is designed following the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern to ensure modularity, scalability, and ease of maintenance. The selected technology stack aligns with the system specifications, emphasizing usability, performance, reliability, and future extensibility.

## **2. Architecture Overview**

The Simple Calculator application follows the **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** architectural pattern, which separates the application into three interconnected components:

1. **Model:** Manages the core logic and arithmetic operations.
2. **View:** Handles the GUI components and user interactions.
3. **Controller:** Acts as an intermediary between the Model and View, processing user inputs and updating the UI accordingly.

### **2.1 MVC Diagram**

While a visual diagram cannot be presented in text, the following description outlines the interactions:

- **User** interacts with the **View** (GUI).
- **View** sends user inputs to the **Controller**.
- **Controller** processes inputs by invoking methods in the **Model**.
- **Model** performs computations and returns results to the **Controller**.
- **Controller** updates the **View** with results or error messages.
