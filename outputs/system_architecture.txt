### High-Level System Architecture for Simple Python Calculator

This document presents the high-level system architecture for the **Simple Python Calculator** based on the provided system specifications. The architecture follows the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** design pattern to ensure modularity, maintainability, and scalability. Additionally, the chosen technology stack aligns with the project requirements and facilitates efficient development and deployment.

---

## 1. Architectural Overview

The MVC architectural pattern separates the application into three interconnected components:

1. **Model:** Manages the core logic and data of the application.
2. **View:** Handles the graphical user interface (GUI) and user interactions.
3. **Controller:** Acts as an intermediary between the Model and View, processing user inputs and updating the View accordingly.

This separation of concerns enhances code readability, maintainability, and facilitates future enhancements.

## 4. Detailed Component Interactions

### 4.1 User Interaction Flow

1. **User Input:**
   - The user enters numerical values into the input fields and selects an arithmetic operation by clicking the corresponding button or using keyboard shortcuts.

2. **Event Handling:**
   - The View captures the user action and notifies the Controller via the Event Handler.

3. **Processing:**
   - The Controller retrieves the input values and the selected operation.
   - It invokes the appropriate function in the Model's Calculator Engine to perform the computation.

4. **Computation and Validation:**
   - The Model processes the calculation, utilizing the Input Validator to ensure input integrity (e.g., checking for numeric values, preventing division by zero).

5. **Result Handling:**
   - If the computation is successful, the Model returns the result to the Controller.
   - If an error occurs (e.g., invalid input, division by zero), the Model communicates the error status to the Controller.

6. **View Update:**
   - The Controller instructs the View to display the result or an error message accordingly.
   - The View updates the Display Frame with the computation result or shows an appropriate error message.

### 4.2 Error Handling Flow

1. **Error Detection:**
   - During input validation or computation, the Model detects an error (e.g., non-numeric input, division by zero).

2. **Error Propagation:**
   - The Model communicates the error to the Controller, specifying the type and details of the error.

3. **User Notification:**
   - The Controller invokes the Error Handling Module to determine the appropriate user-facing message.
   - The View displays the error message in the Display Area, guiding the user to rectify the issue.

4. **Logging (Optional):**
   - The Error Handling Module, in conjunction with the Logging Module, records the error details for developer reference and debugging.
