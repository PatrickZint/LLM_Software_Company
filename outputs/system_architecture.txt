# High-Level System Architecture for Simple Python Calculator Application

## **1. Overview**

The proposed system architecture for the Simple Python Calculator Application is designed to ensure modularity, scalability, and maintainability. The architecture follows the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** design pattern, which separates the application into three interconnected components:

- **Model:** Manages the calculation logic and data.
- **View:** Handles the graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter.
- **Controller:** Acts as an intermediary between the Model and View, managing user input and application flow.

This separation of concerns facilitates easier maintenance, testing, and future enhancements.

## **5. Interaction Between Components**

1. **User Interaction:**
   - Users interact with the **View** by clicking buttons or entering input.
   
2. **Event Handling:**
   - The **Controller** captures these events through event handlers.
   
3. **Input Validation:**
   - Before processing, the **Controller** utilizes the **Validation Module** within the **Model** to ensure inputs are valid.
   
4. **Calculation Execution:**
   - Valid inputs are sent to the **Calculation Engine** in the **Model**, which performs the necessary arithmetic operations.
   
5. **Error Detection:**
   - If an error occurs (e.g., division by zero), the **Error Handling Module** detects it and generates an appropriate error message.
   
6. **Updating the View:**
   - The **Controller** receives the result or error message from the **Model** and updates the **View’s Display Screens** accordingly.
   
7. **Continuous Operation:**
   - The architecture supports sequential calculations by maintaining the state within the **Controller**, allowing users to perform multiple operations without resetting.

## **6. Component Design Details**

### **6.1. GUI Module (View)**

- **Responsive Layout:** Utilize Tkinter’s `grid` geometry manager to arrange buttons in a familiar calculator layout. Implement dynamic resizing to adapt to different window sizes.
  
- **Display Areas:** Implement three separate display labels or text fields for current input, ongoing operations, and results. Use appropriate Tkinter widgets (e.g., `Label`, `Entry`) with clear fonts and color schemes for readability.
  
- **Button Interactions:** Bind each button to corresponding event handlers in the Controller. Ensure visual feedback such as button highlighting on hover or click using Tkinter’s styling options.

### **6.2. Logic Module (Model)**

- **Arithmetic Operations:** Define functions for each basic arithmetic operation. Ensure they handle edge cases, such as division by zero.
  
- **Expression Parsing:** Implement a safe parser that respects operator precedence without using the insecure `eval()` function. Consider using the Shunting Yard algorithm or leveraging Python’s `ast` module for parsing expressions.
  
- **Sequential Calculations:** Maintain a calculation stack or similar structure to handle multiple operations in sequence, allowing users to build complex expressions incrementally.

### **6.3. Error Handling Module**

- **Division by Zero:** Detect attempts to divide by zero and trigger an error state with an appropriate message.
  
- **Invalid Inputs:** Prevent multiple decimal points in a single number and disallow consecutive operators. Replace previous operators if a new operator is entered immediately after.
  
- **Overflow/Underflow:** Monitor the size of numerical results and adjust the display or notify users if results exceed display capacity or numerical limits.

### **6.4. Controller Module**

- **Event Listeners:** Assign each button in the View to a specific function within the Controller that manages the corresponding action.
  
- **State Management:** Keep track of the current input, the ongoing operation, and the result to facilitate seamless user interactions and calculations.
  
- **Communication Flow:** Ensure efficient and secure communication between the View and Model, handling data flow and maintaining application integrity.
