Based upon your system specifications, a high-level architecture for this application would look something like below; 
  1. Frontend Development : AngularJs will be used to build an interactive client side user interface where users can interact with our blogging platform., VueJS could also potentially enhance the UI/UX design and animations.. The frontend code is managed using Git version control system hosted on GitHub,. CI/CD pipeline Jenkins would automate testing, deployment processes ensuring efficient development practices.
  2. Backend Development : Nodejs will be used to build a scalable server-side application which interacts with our database (MongoDB).. Express framework facilitates easy building of web applications., The backend code is also managed using Git version control system hosted on GitHub,.. Jenkins CI/CD pipeline automates testing, deployment processes ensuring efficient development practices.
  3. Database : MongoDB will be used for storing and managing data related to users & blogs.. Its document-based model allows flexibility in schema structure which can grow with increasing amount of stored information., The database is managed using AWS services including IAM service providing secure resource access at scale,. Load balancing solutions provided by Amazon EC2 instances help distribute incoming application traffic effectively.
  4. Server : All server related activities such as compute, storage and management are handled through the use of Managed Services offered on AWs.. This abstracts away many complexities involved with setting up servers., AWS services like Elastic Beanstalk can handle deployment & scaling ensuring our blogging platform is highly available,. Security measures including SSL certificates for both client-server communication (Frontend to Backend) ensures data security.
  5. Infrastructure: Kubernetes would be used as the container orchestration system managing and automating deployments of containers., This allows independent control over service scalability making it ideal when dealing with a microservices architecture.. AWS services like EKS could integrate well within our existing stack providing efficient management & scaling solutions for each individual node on which your application is deployed.
  6. Performance : Techniques such as minimizing DOM manipulations in JavaScript, caching static files and utilizing asynchronous programming will be employed., Server-side rendering (SSR) can also potentially enhance initial page load times,. Regular code reviews would ensure quality checks are carried out at every stage of development ensuring minimal bugs/issues post deployment..
In conclusion this architecture offers scalability & flexibility with various services provided by AWS. It leverages the strengths and efficiencies that Kubernetes provides for managing containerized applications., This setup is beneficial as it allows us to deploy our individual components (frontend, backend) independently while maintaining their connections,. Additionally VueJs could be integrated into an AngularJS application effectively providing additional UI/UX design capabilities.. 
  7. Version Control : Git along with GitHub will manage source control ensuring no code overwrites or loss due versioning differences between team members,.. It also allows tracking changes over the course of development and provides environment that promotes collaboration,. These practices ensure efficient software developmenT., Testing is conducted during each phase to catch any potential bugs/issues early on which could save significant time later down the line when issues are discovered post deployment.
