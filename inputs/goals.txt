Build a basic N-body simulation in 2D to model gravitational interactions between multiple planets using Newtonian physics.
Features:
- Calculate gravitational forces, velocities, and positions
- Output the forces and positions at each time step
- 2D visualization in a GUI window
- Dynamically handle any number of celestial bodies
